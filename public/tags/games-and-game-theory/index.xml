Games are an ideal benchmark for computational intelligence techniques, as creating an interesting opponent for humans requires software that is not only challenging, but also able to induce the tactics used by its adversaries. In this research line, I first worked on an AI able to model the opponent&amp;rsquo;s behavior in the iterated Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma using EAs
,
, during my PhD co-supervision of Marco Gaudesi. I then tackled the automatic development of bots for the real-time strategy game StarCraft
, submitting the first participant to the Student StarCraft AI Competition being entirely designed by another algorithm. A few years ago I started an ongoing project on developing competitive AIs for HearthStone, a collectible card game played online
,
,
. In the scope of these activities, since 2017 I have been co-chairing the session dedicated to games in the EvoSTAR conference.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
