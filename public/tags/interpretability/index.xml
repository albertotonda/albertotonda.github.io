      <description>&lt;p&gt;While generally effective, models obtained through machine learning (ML) are often black boxes, as it is practically impossible for humans to infer their decision processes, due to their sheer complexity. Some of my early works dealt with 
, and 
 
 with 
. More recently I investigated the relationships between 
, and experimented with the translation of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques from the 
. Furthermore, I explored different approaches to feature and sample selection, the process of identifying the most compact sect of meaningful information to explain a ML algorithm decisions on a target problem, often employing Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), see for example 
, 
, 
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am recognized as one of the experts of this niche combining EAs and ML, and as a consequence I co-organized tutorials on the subject in several specialized conferences (ACM GECCO, PPSN) plus an invited lecture in the summer school organized by 
 &lt;em&gt;Improving Applicability of Nature-Inspired Optimisation by Joining Theory and Practice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
