 abstract = {The production system of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria involves several processes, but its impact on bacteria resistance is still not well understood. This system can be defined as a complex one since it depends on multiple scales: the Genomic, the Cellular and the Population scale. The scarcity of data available for building models leads us to propose an approach that makes use of expert knowledge. In this paper we present a semiautomatic modelling tool, LIDEOGRAM and discuss how it contributes to insight formulation and rapid hypothesis testing. New results show that LIDEOGRAM is able to produce more robust modelling hypotheses when experts can interact and revisit the genomic data preprocessing.},
