 abstract = {Industrial manipulators are robots used to replace humans in dangerous or repetitive tasks. Also, these devices are often used for applications where high precision and accuracy is required. The increase of backlash caused by wear, that is, the increase of the amount by which teeth space exceeds the thickness of gear teeth, might be a significant problem, that could lead to impaired performances or even abrupt failures. However, maintenance is difficult to schedule because backlash cannot be directly measured and its effects only appear in closed loops. This paper proposes a novel technique, based on an Evolutionary Algorithm, to estimate the increase of backlash in a robot joint transmission. The peculiarity of this method is that it only requires measurements from the motor encoder. Experimental evaluation on a real-world test case demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.},
