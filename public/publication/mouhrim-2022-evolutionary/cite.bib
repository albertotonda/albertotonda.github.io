 abstract = {In this work, we propose to use a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm to set the discretization thresholds for gene expression profiles, using feedback from a classifier in order to maximize the accuracy of the predictions based on the discretized gene expression levels, while at the same time minimizing the number of different profiles obtained, to ease the understanding of the expert. The methodology is applied to a dataset containing COVID-19 patients that developed either mild or severe symptoms. The results show that the evolutionary approach performs better than a traditional discretization based on statistical analysis, and that it does preserve the sense-making necessary for practitioners to trust the results.},
