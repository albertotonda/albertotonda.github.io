 abstract = {The incessant progress in manufacturing technology is posing new challenges to microprocessor designers. Several activities that were originally supposed to be part of the pre-silicon design phase are migrating after tape-out, when the first silicon prototypes are available. The paper describes a post-silicon methodology for devising functional failing tests. Therefore, suited to be exploited by microprocessor producer to detect, analyze and debug speed paths during verification, speed-stepping, or other critical activities. The proposed methodology is based on an evolutionary algorithm and exploits a versatile toolkit named Î¼GP. The paper describes how to take into account complex hardware characteristics and architectural details of such complex devices. The experimental evaluation clearly demonstrates the potential of this line of research.},
