 abstract = {Program Trace Optimization (PTO) is a framework that provides automatic representation design for arbitrary problem structures by separating problem specification from search algorithm application. Problems in PTO are specified through two components: a generator that creates candidate solutions and a fitness function that evaluates them. A key strength of PTO is its ability to work with unrestricted programs as generators. We explore PTO's application to sophisticated generators based on language models, using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) as our case study. Our results demonstrate how PTO can effectively search the space of programs generated by language models trained on domain-specific languages, with context-aware operators that automatically preserve the model's statistical patterns during evolutionary search. This work shows how PTO can seamlessly incorporate advanced generative methods without requiring modification of the underlying search algorithms.},
