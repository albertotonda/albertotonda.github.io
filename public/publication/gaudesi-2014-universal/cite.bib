 abstract = {This paper presents a genotype-level distance metric for Genetic Programming (GP) based on the symmetric difference concept: first, the information contained in individuals is expressed as a set of symbols (the content of each node, its position inside the tree, and recurring parent-child structures); then, the difference between two individuals is computed considering the number of elements belonging to one, but not both, of their symbol sets.},
