 abstract = {Gas chemical sensors are strongly affected by drift, i.e., changes in sensors’ response with time, that may turn statistical models commonly used for classification completely useless after a period of time. This paper presents a new classifier that embeds an adaptive stage able to reduce drift effects. The proposed system exploits a state-of-the-art evolutionary strategy to iteratively tweak the coefficients of a linear transformation able to transparently transform raw measures in order to mitigate the negative effects of the drift. The system operates continuously. The optimal correction strategy is learnt without a-priori models or other hypothesis on the behavior of physical-chemical sensors. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on a real problem.},
