 abstract = {Unlike other digestive proteases, pepsin specificity is low. It is therefore particularly difficult to determine a priori which peptides will be released during gastric digestion, and hence in the small intestine. Detailed information about food protein truncation during digestion is however critical to understanding and optimizing the availability of bioactives, or limiting allergen release. A stochastic model that dynamically simulates the nature and quantity of peptides that are likely to be produced during pepsin hydrolysis is presented. Model predictions are compared with experimental data taken from (Grosvenor et al. 2014), which includes a list of 89 monitored peptides arising from pepsin hydrolysis of bovine lactoferrin.},
