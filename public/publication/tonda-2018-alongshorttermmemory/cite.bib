 abstract = {Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a relatively recent addition to the field of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). LSTM networks are specifically tailored for machine learning of time series, where the outputs of a system are not just a function of their inputs, but also of a internal state. The state itself can be seen as dependent on the historical series of all inputs seen by the system up to that point in time. In this paper, we present an application of LSTM networks to the modeling of biscuit baking. Starting from 16 real-world time series of biscuit baking, gathered by the United Biscuits company under different conditions, we show how the proposed LSTM network can correctly predict unseen values. Remarkably, the network is also able to reproduce a dynamic behavior up to variations that might be overlooked as noise.},
