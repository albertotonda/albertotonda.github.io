 abstract = {Background: Not being well controlled by therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2 agonist bronchodilators is a major concern for severe-asthma patients. The current treatment option for these patients is the use of biologicals such as anti-IgE treatment, omalizumab, as an add-on therapy. Despite the accepted use of omalizumab, patients do not always benefit from it. Therefore, there is a need to identify reliable biomarkers as predictors of omalizumab response. Methods: Two novel computational algorithms, machine-learning based Recursive Ensemble Feature Selection (REFS) and rule-based algorithm Logic Explainable Networks (LEN), were used on open accessible mRNA expression data from moderate-to-severe asthma patients to identify genes as predictors of omalizumab response. Results: With REFS, the number of features was reduced from 28,402 genes to 5 genes while obtaining a cross-validated accuracy of 0.975. The 5 responsiveness predictive genes encode the following proteins: Coiled-coil domain- containing protein 113 (CCDC113), Solute Carrier Family 26 Member 8 (SLC26A), Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3D (PPP1R3D), C-Type lectin Domain Family 4 member C (CLEC4C) and LOC100131780 (not annotated). The LEN algorithm found 4 identical genes with REFS: CCDC113, SLC26A8 PPP1R3D and LOC100131780. Literature research showed that the 4 identified responsiveness predicting genes are associated with mucosal immunity, cell metabolism, and airway remodeling.},
