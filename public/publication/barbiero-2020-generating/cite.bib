 abstract = {In the field of artificial intelligence, agents learn how to take decisions by fitting their parameters on a set of samples called training set. Similarly, a core set is a subset of the training samples such that, if an agent exploits this set to fit its parameters instead of the whole training set, then the quality of the inferences does not change significantly. Relaxing the constraint that restricts the search for core sets to the available data, neural networks may be used to generate virtual samples, called archetype set, containing the same kind of information. This work illustrates the features of GH-ARCH, a recently proposed self-organizing hierarchical neural network for archetype discovery. Experiments show how the use of archetypes allows both ML agents to make fast and accurate predictions and human experts to make sense of such decisions by analyzing few important samples.},
