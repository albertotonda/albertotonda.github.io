Several of my early research activities were centered around the development of automated techniques to support hardware testing, ranging from the generation of programs to test specific parts of the hardware~\cite{grosso2012software,grosso2011functional,ciganda2012automatic,sanchez2011evolution,perez2011functional,sanchez2011onthefunctional}, to fail-test generation for complex CPUs~\cite{sanchez2011evolutionary,sanchez2011postsilicon,sanchez2011automatic,perez2009onthegeneration}, to compensation of defects in electronic noses~\cite{dicarlo2011increasing,dicarlo2011covariance,dicarlo2010towards,dicarlo2010exploiting}. In the domain of software, I applied the same ideas to software testing~\cite{gandini2010aframework,marino2016ageneralpurpose,gandini2009automatic}, analysis of network protocols~\cite{bucur2016optimizing,bucur2014theimpact,bucur2015black,bucur2014thetradeoffs,cani2014towards,bucur2013anevolutionary}, and detection of malicious applications~\cite{atzeni2018countering,gaudesi2016challenging,gaudesi2015malware}, with these last two activities carried out mainly in the scope of my co-supervision of PhD students Marco Gaudesi and Andrea Marcelli. More recently, I started the co-supervision of PhD student Eliana Giovannitti on the subject of automated discovery of backlash issues in industrial equipment~\cite{giovannitti2022virtual,giovannitti2021exploiting,giovannitti2020virtual}.
