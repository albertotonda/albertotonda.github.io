In recent years, my research activities have branched to the application of ML and EAs to bioinformatics, thanks to a long-standing collaboration with the University of Utrecht (The Netherlands), with the recent addition of partners from the University of Cambridge (UK). The case studies I tackled include automatic discovery of micro-RNA signatures for tumors [[lopezrincon2019automatic]]({{<relref "/publication/lopezrincon-2019-automatic/index.md" >}}), [[lopezrincon2018evolutionary]]({{<relref "/publication/lopezrincon-2018-evolutionary/index.md" >}}), [[barbiero2019understanding]]({{<relref "/publication/barbiero-2019-understanding/index.md" >}}), batch correction of genomic datasets [[lopezrincon2020batch]]({{<relref "/publication/lopezrincon-2020-batch/index.md" >}}), and automatic primer design for viruses, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 [[lopezrincon2021classification]]({{<relref "/publication/lopezrincon-2021-classification/index.md" >}}), [[lopezrincon2021design]]({{<relref "/publication/lopezrincon-2021-design/index.md" >}}). Following these activities, I joined COST Action CA18131 \emph{Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques in Human Microbiome Studies} (2019-2023), where I am currently one of the two representatives for France in the Management Committee.
