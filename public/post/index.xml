      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;invited-talk-at-encals-2022&#34;&gt;Invited talk at ENCALS 2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 3rd, 2022, I had the pleasure of giving an invited talk at the first Non-Coding RNA in Motor Neuron Diseases (MND) and Amyothropic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) International Symposium, a side event of the 
 in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject of my talk was feature selection of microRNA biomarkers to help machine learning robustly classifying diseases. The application I presented is cancer classification, based on a 2020 work in cooperation with Alejandro Lopez-Rincon and several other authors. The technique proposed in the study, Recursive Ensemble Feature Selection, can in principle be applied to datasets from other diseases, and during the symposium we discussed the possibility of applying it to an ALS dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank all the ENCALS organizing committee, and in particular 
, for the kind invite and the productive interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;silver-medal-at-the-humies-awards-gecco-2022&#34;&gt;Silver medal at the HUMIES awards, GECCO 2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 13th, 2022, I had the pleasure of receiving the Silver Medal at the HUMIES (
) held in Boston, MA, USA. The prize was awarded for a human-competitive result obtained using evolutionary computation. Me and my collaborators (Eric Claassen, Etienne Coz, Johan Garssen, Aletta D. Kraneveld, Alejandro Lopez Rincon, Lucero Mendoza Maldonado, Carmina A. Perez Romero, Patrick Tabeling, Jessica Vanhomwegen) worked on the automatic discovery of primers for virus, with a specific application to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
