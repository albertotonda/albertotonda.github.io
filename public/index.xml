Most of the recent, impressive successes of AI are based on machine learning (ML), techniques able to learn predictive models for a given phenomenon directly from data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While generally effective, models obtained through ML are often black boxes, as it is practically impossible for humans to infer their decision processes, due to their sheer complexity. For applications in fields like health and food science, black-box models are impractical, as for domain experts it is unaccaptable to just apply a solution without understanding it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my research, I tackled the question of obtaining human-readable data-driven models using different approaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="white-box-ai">White-box AI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some of my early works dealt with creating white-box, human-readable ML models such as systems of Ordinary Differential Equations
, generation of computer code for a specific task using Genetic Programming
, or modeling the behavior of a player as a stochastic Finite State Machine
,
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More recently, I worked on interpretable-by-design neuro-symbolic approaches
, also contributing to proposing a more rigorous, measurable definition of &lt;em>interpretability&lt;/em> for AI systems
.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--
## Integration of expert knowledge in AI
## Feature selection
Another way of making a ML model understandable is by reducing the number of features (variables) that it can use to take a decision; however, removing information might impair the performance of the algorithm. This is the principle behind _feature selection_, a subdomain of AI focused on finding the minimal amount of necessary information for the algorithm.
I developed novel techniques for unsupervised feature selection

&lt;p>Some of my early works dealt with
, and
with
. More recently I investigated the relationships between
, and experimented with the translation of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques from the
. Furthermore, I explored different approaches to feature and sample selection, the process of identifying the most compact sect of meaningful information to explain a ML algorithm decisions on a target problem, often employing Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), see for example
,
,
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am recognized as one of the experts of this niche combining EAs and ML, and as a consequence I co-organized tutorials on the subject in several specialized conferences (ACM GECCO, PPSN) plus an invited lecture in the summer school organized by
&lt;em>Improving Applicability of Nature-Inspired Optimisation by Joining Theory and Practice&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI in food processing</title><link>https://albertotonda.github.io/research/food-processing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://albertotonda.github.io/research/food-processing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Starting with my first post-doctoral position, I applied computational intelligence techniques to the field of food processing, a domain where the limited amount of data and the abundance of expert knowledge pose interesting challenges to ML and AI algorithms. This activity later became the main focus of my career as a permanent researcher at INRA/INRAE. The case studies I tackled, carried out mainly in the scope of the co-supervisions of PhD students Etienne Descamps and Thomas Chabin, include modeling diary emulsions
,
,
freeze-drying of lactic acid bacteria
,
,
,
biscuit cooking
,
cleaning processes of industrial machines
,
,
behavior of the pepsin enzyme

,
,
ecosystem services

I later chaired the European COST Action CA15118 &lt;em>Mathematical and Computer Science Methods for Food Science and Industry&lt;/em> (2016-2020), a networking project that gathered experts from both academia and industry, to make a point on the state of the art and the possible future trajectories of the sector. The project led to several reviews and position papers

Games are an ideal benchmark for computational intelligence techniques, as creating an interesting opponent for humans requires software that is not only challenging, but also able to induce the tactics used by its adversaries. In this research line, I first worked on an AI able to model the opponent&amp;rsquo;s behavior in the iterated Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma using EAs
,
, during my PhD co-supervision of Marco Gaudesi. I then tackled the automatic development of bots for the real-time strategy game StarCraft
, submitting the first participant to the Student StarCraft AI Competition being entirely designed by another algorithm. A few years ago I started an ongoing project on developing competitive AIs for HearthStone, a collectible card game played online

&lt;h2 id="abstract-of-the-talk">Abstract of the talk&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are stochastic optimization techniques, designed to tackle objective functions for which other techniques fail (for example, due to the impossibility of computing derivatives, non-convexity of the function landscape, or sheer size of the search space). Genetic programming (GP) is a technique belonging to the field of EAs, designed to stochastically explore search spaces of complex structures, for example trees or graphs. Since these structures can be used to represent computer programs, GP has been successfully applied to the task of program synthesis since the early 2000s, automatically generating computer programs for specific applications. In this talk, I will briefly introduce EAs and GP, before going over the current state of the art in EA-based program synthesis, focusing in particular on strengths, limitations, and possible ways forward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PEPR B-BEST MuSiHC</title><link>https://albertotonda.github.io/project/2025-musihc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://albertotonda.github.io/project/2025-musihc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Multi-Size Hybrid Cell Models (MuSiHC) is a 4-year project I am leading, funded by the

is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="video">Video&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2vj0WcvH5c?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Youtube&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{{&amp;lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bilibili&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{{&amp;lt; bilibili id=&amp;quot;BV1WV4y1r7DF&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Video file&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your &lt;code>assets/media/&lt;/code> media library or in your
, and then embedding them with the &lt;em>video&lt;/em> shortcode:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{{&amp;lt; video src=&amp;quot;my_video.mp4&amp;quot; controls=&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="podcast">Podcast&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page&amp;rsquo;s folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the &lt;em>audio&lt;/em> shortcode:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{{&amp;lt; audio src=&amp;quot;ambient-piano.mp3&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Try it out:&lt;/p>
&lt;audio controls >
&lt;source src="https://albertotonda.github.io/_examples/teaching/js/ambient-piano.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
&lt;/audio>
&lt;h2 id="test-students">Test students&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the &lt;code>spoiler&lt;/code> shortcode:&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/details>
&lt;h2 id="math">Math&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code>math&lt;/code> option in your &lt;code>config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To render &lt;em>inline&lt;/em> or &lt;em>block&lt;/em> math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code> or &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code>, respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="flex px-4 py-3 mb-6 rounded-md bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900">

is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="video">Video&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2vj0WcvH5c?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Youtube&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{{&amp;lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bilibili&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{{&amp;lt; bilibili id=&amp;quot;BV1WV4y1r7DF&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Video file&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your &lt;code>assets/media/&lt;/code> media library or in your
, and then embedding them with the &lt;em>video&lt;/em> shortcode:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{{&amp;lt; video src=&amp;quot;my_video.mp4&amp;quot; controls=&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="podcast">Podcast&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page&amp;rsquo;s folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the &lt;em>audio&lt;/em> shortcode:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{{&amp;lt; audio src=&amp;quot;ambient-piano.mp3&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Try it out:&lt;/p>
&lt;audio controls >
&lt;source src="https://albertotonda.github.io/_examples/teaching/python/ambient-piano.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
&lt;/audio>
&lt;h2 id="test-students">Test students&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the &lt;code>spoiler&lt;/code> shortcode:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">{{&lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nt">spoiler&lt;/span> &lt;span class="na">text&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">&amp;#34;👉 Click to view the solution&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>}}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">You found me!
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">{{&lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">spoiler&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>}}

&lt;div class="rounded-lg bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 p-2">

&lt;/div>
&lt;/details>
&lt;h2 id="math">Math&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code>math&lt;/code> option in your &lt;code>config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To render &lt;em>inline&lt;/em> or &lt;em>block&lt;/em> math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code> or &lt;code>{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code>, respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="flex px-4 py-3 mb-6 rounded-md bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900">
&lt;span class="pr-3 pt-1 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-300">

This COST Action aims at making randomised optimisation algorithms widely competitive in practice by identifying and reducing obstacles to their adoption at the scientific, technical, economic, and human levels. It focuses on meeting the needs of practitioners, from whose activities the economic value of optimisation solvers stems. These needs are taken as the driving force for new theoretical, methodological, and technical advances leading to the sustainable development of widely available software tools, training materials and programmes, and ultimately to more extensive acceptance and deployment of these methods.&lt;/p>
