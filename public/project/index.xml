      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-Size Hybrid Cell Models (MuSiHC) is a 4-year project I am leading, funded by the 
 for over 1.3M Euros. MuSiHC focuses on learning models for bacterial metabolic network, resorting to hybrid approaches combining classical systems of differential equations and more recent machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is in cooperation with several partners: INRIA Grenoble, MICALIS institute, MaIAGE lab, Toulouse Biotechnology Institute, Toulouse White Biotechnology, and University Lyon 1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;FutureFoodS is a Horizon Europe co-funded project I am participant of, running from 2024 to 2034, involving 86 partners from 29 countries. The FutureFoodS partnership aims to collectively achieve healthy, safe, environmentally friendly, socially secure, fair, and economically viable food systems for Europe.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Randomised Optimisation Algorithms Research Network (CA22137 ROAR-NET) is a COST Action, a 4-year networking project funded by the 
. This COST Action aims at making randomised optimisation algorithms widely competitive in practice by identifying and reducing obstacles to their adoption at the scientific, technical, economic, and human levels. It focuses on meeting the needs of practitioners, from whose activities the economic value of optimisation solvers stems. These needs are taken as the driving force for new theoretical, methodological, and technical advances leading to the sustainable development of widely available software tools, training materials and programmes, and ultimately to more extensive acceptance and deployment of these methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, I am a regular participant. For more information, check out the
