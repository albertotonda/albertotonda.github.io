#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I work as a senior permanent researcher (directeur de recherche) at [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr)'s Applied Mathematics and Computer Science research Paris-Saclay lab ([UMR 518 MIA-Paris](https://mia-ps.inrae.fr/)) near Paris, France. My research interests include machine learning, evolutionary optimization, and neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence, with main applications to food science and health. I am part of the EKINOCS team, whose focus is on merging human expert knowledge with AI for real-world applications.
