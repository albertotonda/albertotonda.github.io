Randomised Optimisation Algorithms Research Network (CA22137 ROAR-NET) is a COST Action, a 4-year networking project funded by the [European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)](https://www.cost.eu/). This COST Action aims at making randomised optimisation algorithms widely competitive in practice by identifying and reducing obstacles to their adoption at the scientific, technical, economic, and human levels. It focuses on meeting the needs of practitioners, from whose activities the economic value of optimisation solvers stems. These needs are taken as the driving force for new theoretical, methodological, and technical advances leading to the sustainable development of widely available software tools, training materials and programmes, and ultimately to more extensive acceptance and deployment of these methods.

In this project, I am a regular participant. For more information, check out the [ROAR-NET official website](https://roar-net.eu/).
