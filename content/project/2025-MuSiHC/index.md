Multi-Size Hybrid Cell Models (MuSiHC) is a 4-year project, funded by the PEPR B-BEST ("Biomasses, biotechnologies et technologies durables pour la chimie et les carburants"). MuSiHC focuses on learning models for bacterial metabolic network, resorting to hybrid approaches combining classical systems of differential equations and more recent machine learning algorithms.

The project is in cooperation with several partners: INRIA Grenoble, MICALIS institute, MaIAGE lab, Toulouse Biotechnology Institute, Toulouse White Biotechnology, and University Lyon 1.
