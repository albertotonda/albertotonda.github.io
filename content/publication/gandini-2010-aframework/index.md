abstract: The complexity of cell phones is continually increasing, with regards to
  both hardware and software parts. As many complex devices, their components are
  usually designed and verified separately by specialized teams of engineers and programmers.
  However, even if each isolated part is working flawlessly, it often happens that
  bugs in one software application arise due to the interaction with other modules.
  Those software misbehaviors become particularly critical when they affect the residual
  battery life, causing power dissipation. An automatic approach to detect power-affecting
  software defects is proposed. The approach is intended to be part of a qualifying
  verification plan and complete human expertise. Motorola, always at the forefront
  of researching innovations in the product development chain, experimented the approach
  on a mobile phone prototype during a partnership with Politecnico di Torino. Software
  errors unrevealed by all human-designed tests have been detected by the proposed
  framework, two out of three critical from the power consumption point of view, thus
  enabling Motorola to further improve its verification plans. Details of the tests
  and experimental results are presented.
