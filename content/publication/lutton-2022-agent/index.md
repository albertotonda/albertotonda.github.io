abstract: Human digestion is a complex process that involves diffusion and reaction
  effects where enzymes govern the denaturation and breakdown of proteins. In this
  work we build an agent-based model of gastric digestion of some gel pieces of plant
  proteins (rapeseed). This model has been designed to allow a faster computation
  compared with dynamic molecular models, fast calculations are actually a prerequisite
  for learning a model from experimental data. We have so far exploited additional
  coarse-grained equation-based models to learn some parameters using evolutionary
  optimization. Future developments will be devoted to the learning of all the parameters.
