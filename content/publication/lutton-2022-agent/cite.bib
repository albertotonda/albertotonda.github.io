 abstract = {Human digestion is a complex process that involves diffusion and reaction effects where enzymes govern the denaturation and breakdown of proteins. In this work we build an agent-based model of gastric digestion of some gel pieces of plant proteins (rapeseed). This model has been designed to allow a faster computation compared with dynamic molecular models, fast calculations are actually a prerequisite for learning a model from experimental data. We have so far exploited additional coarse-grained equation-based models to learn some parameters using evolutionary optimization. Future developments will be devoted to the learning of all the parameters.},
