abstract: 'The use of anti-virus software has become something of an act of faith.
  A recent study showed that more than 80% of all personal computers have anti-virus
  software installed. However, the protection mechanisms in place are far less effective
  than users would expect. Malware analysis is a classical example of cat-and-mouse
  game: as new anti-virus techniques are developed, malware authors respond with new
  ones to thwart analysis. Every day, anti-virus companies analyze thousands of malware
  that has been collected through honeypots, hence they restrict the research to only
  already existing viruses. This article describes a novel method for malware obfuscation
  based an evolutionary opcode generator and a special ad-hoc packer. The results
  can be used by the security industry to test the ability of their system to react
  to malware mutations.'
