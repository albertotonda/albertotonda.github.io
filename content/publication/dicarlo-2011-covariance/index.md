abstract: Electronic Noses (ENs) might represent a simple, fast, high sample throughput
  and economic alternative to conventional analytical instruments. However, gas sensors
  drift still limits the EN adoption in real industrial setups due to high recalibration
  effort and cost. In fact, pattern recognition (PaRC) models built in the training
  phase become useless after a period of time, in some cases a few weeks. Although
  algorithms to mitigate the drift date back to the early 90 this is still a challenging
  issue for the chemical sensor community. Among other approaches, adaptive drift
  correction methods adjust the PaRC model in parallel with data acquisition without
  need of periodic calibration. Self‐Organizing Maps (SOMs) and Adaptive Resonance
  Theory (ART) networks have been already tested in the past with fair success. This
  paper presents and discusses an original methodology based on a Covariance Matrix
  Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA‐ES), suited for stochastic optimization of complex
  problems.
