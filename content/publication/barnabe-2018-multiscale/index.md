abstract: 'Designing and processing complex matter and materials are key objectives
  of bioresource and bioproduct research. Modeling approaches targeting such systems
  have to account for their two main sources of complexity: their intrinsic multi-scale
  nature; and the variability and heterogeneity inherent to all living systems. Here
  we provide insight into methods developed at the Food & Bioproduct Engineering division
  (CEPIA) of the French National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRA). This brief
  survey focuses on innovative research lines that tackle complexity by mobilizing
  different approaches with complementary objectives. On one hand cognitive approaches
  aim to uncover the basic mechanisms and laws underlying the emerging collective
  properties and macroscopic behavior of soft-matter and granular systems, using numerical
  and experimental methods borrowed from physics and mechanics. The corresponding
  case studies are dedicated to the structuring and phase behavior of biopolymers,
  powders and granular materials, and to the evolution of these structures caused
  by external constraints. On the other hand machine learning approaches can deal
  with process optimizations and outcome predictions by extracting useful information
  and correlations from huge datasets built from experiments at different length scales
  and in heterogeneous conditions. These predictive methods are illustrated in the
  context of cheese ripening, grape maturity prediction and bacterial production.'
