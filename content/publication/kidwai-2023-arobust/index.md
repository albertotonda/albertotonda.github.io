abstract: 'Background: Not being well controlled by therapy with inhaled corticosteroids
  and long-acting β2 agonist bronchodilators is a major concern for severe-asthma
  patients. The current treatment option for these patients is the use of biologicals
  such as anti-IgE treatment, omalizumab, as an add-on therapy. Despite the accepted
  use of omalizumab, patients do not always benefit from it. Therefore, there is a
  need to identify reliable biomarkers as predictors of omalizumab response. Methods:
  Two novel computational algorithms, machine-learning based Recursive Ensemble Feature
  Selection (REFS) and rule-based algorithm Logic Explainable Networks (LEN), were
  used on open accessible mRNA expression data from moderate-to-severe asthma patients
  to identify genes as predictors of omalizumab response. Results: With REFS, the
  number of features was reduced from 28,402 genes to 5 genes while obtaining a cross-validated
  accuracy of 0.975. The 5 responsiveness predictive genes encode the following proteins:
  Coiled-coil domain- containing protein 113 (CCDC113), Solute Carrier Family 26 Member
  8 (SLC26A), Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3D (PPP1R3D), C-Type lectin
  Domain Family 4 member C (CLEC4C) and LOC100131780 (not annotated). The LEN algorithm
  found 4 identical genes with REFS: CCDC113, SLC26A8 PPP1R3D and LOC100131780. Literature
  research showed that the 4 identified responsiveness predicting genes are associated
  with mucosal immunity, cell metabolism, and airway remodeling.'
