abstract: 'Bayesian networks are stochastic models, widely adopted to encode knowledge
  in several fields. One of the most interesting features of a Bayesian network is
  the possibility of learning its structure from a set of data, and subsequently use
  the resulting model to perform new predictions. Structure learning for such models
  is a NP-hard problem, for which the scientific community developed two main approaches:
  score-and-search metaheuristics, often evolutionary-based, and dependency-analysis
  deterministic algorithms, based on stochastic tests. State-of-the-art solutions
  have been presented in both domains, but all methodologies start from the assumption
  of having access to large sets of learning data available, often numbering thousands
  of samples. This is not the case for many real-world applications, especially in
  the food processing and research industry. This paper proposes an evolutionary approach
  to the Bayesian structure learning problem, specifically tailored for learning sets
  of limited size. Falling in the category of score-and-search techniques, the methodology
  exploits an evolutionary algorithm able to work directly on graph structures, previously
  used for assembly language generation, and a scoring function based on the Akaike
  Information Criterion, a well-studied metric of stochastic model performance. Experimental
  results show that the approach is able to outperform a state-of-the-art dependency-analysis
  algorithm, providing better models for small datasets.'
