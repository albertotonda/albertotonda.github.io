abstract: 'Replicating in silico the structuring dynamics of gel formation stabilized
  by proteins is a relevant challenge for a better understanding of those complex
  systems. Nevertheless, in order to exploit the potentiality of the models, effective
  means to visualize the space of possible solutions must be used. As models of food
  processes become more and more complex, it also becomes harder for the experts to
  thoroughly explore their behavior and find meaningful correlations between parameters.
  If sensibility analysis approaches are powerful tools to answer to a part of this
  problem, they do not allow the global visualization of the nature of the link taking
  place between variables. This information may nevertheless be relevant for a better
  understanding of the law involved in the mechanisms under study. While an analytical
  study is often impractical, graphical visualization tools can help the user to better
  understand the behavior of the model, as well as the possible improvements to be
  performed. Nevertheless, an effective way to explore the model behavior must be
  employed. In this paper, we propose an approach to model exploration that couples
  visualization with evolutionary computation. The case study is a model devised to
  predict milk gel structures, based on a system of differential equations with a
  total of 5 parameters to be set by the expert. Sensitivity analysis on the model
  has been already presented in previous works. During the experiment, several meta-data
  are extracted and made available to the expert: the space distribution of all candidate
  solutions proposed by the evolutionary algorithm; the space distribution of all
  optimal candidate solutions; and global data on the space distribution of the points,
  for each parameter of the model. We show that, using the proposed approach, experts
  are able to reduce the dimension of the model, eventually finding a correlation
  between two of the variables. Reverse-engineering the final outcome of the experiment,
  the emergence of such a pattern is explained by physical laws underlying the oil-in-water
  interface colonization. Thus, the proposed approach shows an improvement over the
  results of the sole sensitivity analysis. While the present work is focused on milk
  gel modeling, the described methodology can be generalized to any kind of phenomenon,
  and can greatly assist the experts in better assessing the behavior of their models.'
