abstract: 'This study compares several hybrid dynamic models built with offline data
  to optimize nanobody production in Escherichia coli. These models combine the insights
  of mechanistic knowledge and Machine Learning algorithms (ML). Four ML algorithms
  were tested: Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT)
  and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The efficacy of each model was analyzed with three
  metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), normalized root
  mean squared error (NRMSE). Results demonstrate that the radial basis function (RBF)
  SVR model performed best simulations, with a NRMSE between 0.063 and 0.665. The
  insights gained are pivotal for advancing computational modeling techniques in biomanufacturing,
  with a specific emphasis on the production of recombinant therapeutic proteins,
  such as nanobodies, using bacterial hosts.'
