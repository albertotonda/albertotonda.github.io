abstract: 'Methodologies and tools from Maths and Computer Science (MCS) are emerging
  as key contributors to modernization and optimization of processes in various disciplines:
  the agri-food sector, however, is not a traditional domain of application for MCS,
  and at the moment there is no community organized around solving the issues of this
  field. The COST Action FoodMC brings together scientists and practitioners from
  MCS and agri-food domains, stimulating the emergence of new research, and structuring
  a new community to coordinate further investigation efforts. Exploiting approaches
  originating at different subfields of MCS, from applied mathematical models to knowledge
  engineering, this COST Action will cover two main topics: understanding and controlling
  agri-food processes; and eco-design of agri-food products. During its first year
  of existence, COST Action FoodMC helped fund several international collaborations
  between European researchers, fostered the drafting of survey papers on food modelling,
  organized meetings for discussion, and co-funded a training school.'
