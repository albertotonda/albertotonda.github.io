abstract: Interaction of food systems and the environment has been in research focus
  for many years. In order to explain this interaction, scholars have developed and
  use various approaches in modelling and understanding this phenomenon. This paper
  gives an overview of three main perspectives in analyzing this issue and provides
  some future perspectives associated with sustainable development goals developed
  by the UN.
