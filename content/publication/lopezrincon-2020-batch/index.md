abstract: 'Modern genomic sequencing machines can measure thousands of probes from
  different specimens. Nevertheless, theoretically comparable datasets can show considerably
  distinguishable properties, depending on both platform and specimen, a phenomenon
  known as batch effect. Batch correction is the technique aiming at removing this
  effect from the data. A possible approach to batch correction is to find a transformation
  function between different datasets, but optimizing the weights of such a function
  is not trivial: As there is no explicit gradient to follow, traditional optimization
  techniques would fail. In this work, we propose to use a state-of-the-art evolutionary
  algorithm, Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, to optimize the weights
  of a transformation function for batch correction. The fitness function is driven
  by the classification accuracy of an ensemble of algorithms on the transformed data.
  The case study selected to test the proposed approach is mRNA gene expression data
  of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a disease for which there is currently no established
  diagnostic test. The transformation function obtained from three datasets, produced
  from different specimens, remarkably improves the performance of classifiers on
  the task of diagnosing Chronic Fatigue. The presented results are an important steppingstone
  towards a reliable diagnostic test for this syndrome.'
