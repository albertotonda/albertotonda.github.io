abstract: Interactive Evolutionary Systems (IES) can generate several designs based
  on a handful of input parameters. Never-theless, the choice of the parameters is
  an open problem and it is limited to a few evaluations as they require human input.
  As a solution, Bayesian Optimization (BO) can be used to tune IES parameters. BO
  is a statistical method that efficiently models and optimizes expensive black-box
  derivative-free functions in few evaluations. In the context of creative IES, such
  as image generators, it can be used in conjunction with user preferences to optimize
  a complex-structured input space, such as variations of artistic images with uniqueness
  and creativity that follow the original concept and the artistic intention. Therefore,
  for this objective, we propose an implementation of BOIES with a metric based on
  user preferences that interactively evaluates a batch of images to evolve a set
  of parameters in Stable Diffusion to create variations with a given human-made artwork.
  Our results proved better than baseline, and against generated images using Neural
  Style Transfer (NST). The resulting images were consistent in terms of uniqueness,
  quality, and following a given concept.
