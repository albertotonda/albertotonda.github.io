abstract: In this paper the application of machine learning techniques for the development
  of constitutive material models is being investigated. A flow stress model, for
  strain rates ranging from 10^−4 to 10^12 (quasi-static to highly dynamic), and temperatures
  ranging from room temperature to over 1000 K, is obtained by beginning directly
  with experimental stress–strain data for Copper. An incrementally objective and
  fully implicit time integration scheme is employed to integrate the hypo-elastic
  constitutive model, which is then implemented into a finite element code for evaluation.
  Accuracy and performance of the flow stress models derived from symbolic regression
  are assessed by comparison to Taylor anvil impact data. The results obtained with
  the free-form constitutive material model are compared to well-established strength
  models such as the Preston–Tonks–Wallace (PTW) model and the Mechanical Threshold
  Stress (MTS) model. Preliminary results show candidate free-form models comparing
  well with data in regions of stress–strain space with sufficient experimental data,
  pointing to a potential means for both rapid prototyping in future model development,
  as well as the use of machine learning in capturing more data as a guide for more
  advanced model development.
