abstract: Branch Prediction Units (BPUs) are highly efficient modules that can significantly
  decrease the negative impact of branches in superscalar and RISC processors. Traditional
  test solutions, mainly based on scan test, are often inadequate to tackle the complexity
  of these architectures, especially when dealing with delay faults that require at-speed
  stimuli application. Moreover, scan test does not represent a viable solution when
  Incoming Inspection or on-line test are considered. In this paper a functional approach
  targeting BPU test is proposed, allowing to generate a suitable test program whose
  effectiveness is independent on the specific implementation of the BPU. The effectiveness
  of the approach is validated on a Branch History Table (BHT) resorting to an open-source
  computer architecture simulator and to an ad hoc developed HDL testbench. Experimental
  results show that the proposed method is able to thoroughly test the BHT, reaching
  complete static fault coverage.
