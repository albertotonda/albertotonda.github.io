abstract: The design of models for dairy products raises a series of difficult issues.
  For instance, considering dairy oil in water emulsions stabilized with milk proteins,
  texture depends in a non-trivial manner on the initial concentration and type of
  proteins, nature of heat treatment and type of homogenisation. Those emulsions,
  involving competitive adsorption of mixed particles in a turbulent way at the oil/water
  interface, are not thermodynamically controlled. Classical models like the Langmuir
  one are thus not able to predict its behaviour with precision (Dickinson, 2011).
  Hybrid models (Descamps, 2014) have been recently proved to be promising for dealing
  with those complex phenomena. We present an extension of this approach, using an
  individual-­‐based framework whose implementation is based on a kinetic Monte Carlo
  approach (MC) combined with a mean field model. MC schemes are widely used in chemical
  science to deal with discrete events (Gillespie, 75). Individual-based models (also
  known as agent-­‐based) are convenient for representing local rules at the nano/micro
  scale, with macroscopic properties appearing as a consequence of an emergence process.
  Individual-­‐based frames, however, often rely on stochastic simulations and require
  time-consuming computations to yield a robust estimation for the emergent quantities.
  In the proposed methodology, computational efficiency is provided by performing
  appropriate simplifications along the simulation process thanks to an ODE-based
  continuous mean field formulation.
