abstract: VALIS is an effective and robust classification algorithm with a focus on
  understandability. Its name stems from Vote-ALlocating Immune System, as it evolves
  a population of artificial antibodies that can bind to the input data, and performs
  classification through a voting process. In the beginning of the training, VALIS
  generates a set of random candidate antibodies; at each iteration, it selects the
  most useful ones to produce new candidates, while the least, are discarded; the
  process is iterated until a user-defined stopping condition. The paradigm allows
  the user to get a visual insight of the learning dynamics, helping to supervise
  the process, pinpoint problems, and tweak feature engineering. VALIS is tested against
  nine state-of-the-art classification algorithms on six popular benchmark problems;
  results demonstrate that it is competitive with well-established black-box techniques,
  and superior in specific corner cases.
