abstract: In the context of social networks, maximizing influence means contacting
  the largest possible number of nodes starting from a set of seed nodes, and assuming
  a model for influence propagation. The real-world applications of influence maximization
  are of uttermost importance, and range from social studies to marketing campaigns.
  Building on a previous work on multi-objective evolutionary influence maximization,
  we propose improvements that not only speed up the optimization process considerably,
  but also deliver higher-quality results. State-of-the-art heuristics are run for
  different sizes of the seed sets, and the results are then used to initialize the
  population of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The proposed approach is
  tested on three publicly available real-world networks, where we show that the evolutionary
  algorithm is able to improve upon the solutions found by the heuristics, while also
  converging faster than an evolutionary algorithm started from scratch.
