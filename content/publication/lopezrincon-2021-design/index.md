abstract: Primer sets are short DNA sequences of 18-22 base pairs, that can be used
  to verify the presence of a virus, and designed to attach to a specific part of
  a viral DNA. Designing a primer set requires choosing a region of DNA, avoiding
  the possibility of hybridization to a similar sequence, as well as considering its
  GC content and $T_m$ (melting temperature). Coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, have
  a considerably large genome (around 30 thousand nucleotides) when compared to other
  viruses. With the rapid rise and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants, it has become a
  priority to breach our lack of specific primers available for diagnosis of this
  new variants. Here, we propose an evolutionary-based approach to primer design,
  able to rapidly deliver a high-quality primer set for a target sequence of the virus
  variant. Starting from viral sequences collected from open repositories, the proposed
  approach is proven able to uncover a specific primer set for the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2
  variant. Only recently identified, B.1.1.7 is already considered potentially dangerous,
  as it presents a considerably higher transmissibility when compared to other variants.
