abstract: 'For several medical treatments, it is possible to observe transcriptional
  variations in gene expressions between responders and non-responders. Modelling
  the correlation between such variations and the patient’s response to drugs as a
  system of Ordinary Differential Equations could be invaluable to improve the efficacy
  of treatments and would represent an important step towards personalized medicine.
  Two main obstacles lie on this path: (i) the number of genes is too large to straightforwardly
  analyze their interactions; (ii) defining the correct parameters for the mathematical
  models of gene interaction is a complex optimization problem, even when a limited
  number of genes is involved. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to creating
  mathematical models able to explain patients’ response to treatment from transcriptional
  variations. The approach is based on: (i) a feature selection algorithm, set to
  identify a minimal set of gene expressions that are highly correlated with treatment
  outcome, (ii) a state-of-the-art evolutionary optimizer, Covariance Matrix Adaptation
  Evolution Strategy, applied to finding the parameters of the mathematical model
  characterizing the relationship between gene expressions and patient responsiveness.
  The proposed methodology is tested on real-world data describing responsiveness
  of asthma patients to Omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to
  immunoglobulin E. In this case study, the presented approach is shown able to identify
  5 genes (out of 28,402) that are transcriptionally relevant to predict treatment
  outcomes, and to deliver a compact mathematical model that is able to explain the
  interaction between the different genes involved.'
