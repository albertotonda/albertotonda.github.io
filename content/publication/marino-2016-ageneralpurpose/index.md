abstract: 'Genetic Improvement is an evolutionary-based technique. Despite its relatively
  recent introduction, several successful applications have been already reported
  in the scientific literature: it has been demonstrated able to modify the code complex
  programs without modifying their intended behavior; to increase performance with
  regards to speed, energy consumption or memory use. Some results suggest that it
  could be also used to correct bugs, restoring the software’s intended functionalities.
  Given the novelty of the technique, however, instances of Genetic Improvement so
  far rely upon ad-hoc, language-specific implementations. In this paper, we propose
  a general framework based on the software engineering’s idea of mutation testing
  coupled with Genetic Programming, that can be easily adapted to different programming
  languages and objective. In a preliminary evaluation, the framework efficiently
  optimizes the code of the md5 hash function in C, Java, and Python.'
