 abstract = {Exploiting the availability of the largest collection of patient-derived xenografts from metastatic colorectal cancer annotated for a response to therapies, this manuscript aims to characterize the biological phenomenon from a mathematical point of view. In particular, we design an experiment in order to investigate how genes interact with each other. By using a shallow neural network model, we find reduced feature subspaces where the resistance phenomenon may be much easier to understand and analyze.},
