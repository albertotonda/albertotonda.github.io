abstract: Exploiting the availability of the largest collection of patient-derived
  xenografts from metastatic colorectal cancer annotated for a response to therapies,
  this manuscript aims to characterize the biological phenomenon from a mathematical
  point of view. In particular, we design an experiment in order to investigate how
  genes interact with each other. By using a shallow neural network model, we find
  reduced feature subspaces where the resistance phenomenon may be much easier to
  understand and analyze.
