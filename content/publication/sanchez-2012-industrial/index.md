abstract: 'Industrial applications of evolutionary algorithms is intended as a resource
  for both experienced users of evolutionary algorithms and researchers that are beginning
  to approach these fascinating optimization techniques. Experienced users will find
  interesting details of real-world problems, advice on solving issues related to
  fitness computation or modeling, and suggestions on how to set the appropriate parameters
  to reach optimal solutions. Beginners will find a thorough introduction to evolutionary
  computation, and a complete presentation of several classes of evolutionary algorithms
  exploited to solve different problems. Inside, scholars will find useful examples
  on how to fill the gap between purely theoretical examples and industrial problems.
  The collection of case studies presented is also extremely appealing for anyone
  interested in Evolutionary Computation, but without direct access to extensive technical
  literature on the subject. After the introduction, each chapter in the book presents
  a test case, and is organized so that it can be read independently from the rest:
  all the information needed to understand the problem and the approach is reported
  in each part. Chapters are grouped by three themes of particular interest for real-world
  applications, namely prototype-based validation, reliability and test generation.
  The authors hope that this volume will help to expose the flexibility and efficiency
  of evolutionary techniques, encouraging more companies to adopt them; and that,
  most of all, you will enjoy your reading.'
