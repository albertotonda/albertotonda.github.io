abstract: The iterated prisoner's dilemma is a widely known model in game theory,
  fundamental to many theories of cooperation and trust among self-interested beings.
  There are many works in literature about developing efficient strategies for this
  problem, both inside and outside the machine learning community. This paper shift
  the focus from finding a ``good strategy'' in absolute terms, to dynamically adapting
  and optimizing the strategy against the current opponent. Turan evolves competitive
  non-deterministic models of the current opponent, and exploit them to predict its
  moves and maximize the payoff as the game develops. Experimental results show that
  the proposed approach is able to obtain good performances against different kind
  of opponent, whether their strategies can or cannot be implemented as finite state
  machines.
