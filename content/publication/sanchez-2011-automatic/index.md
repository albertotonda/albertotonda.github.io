abstract: The 40 years since the appearance of the Intel 4004 deeply changed how microprocessors
  are designed. Today, essential steps in the validation process are performed relying
  on physical dices, analyzing the actual behavior under appropriate stimuli. This
  paper presents a methodology that can be used to devise assembly programs suitable
  for a range of on-silicon activities, like speed debug, timing verification or speed
  binning. The methodology is fully automatic. It exploits the feedback from the microprocessor
  under examination and does not rely on information about its microarchitecture,
  nor does it require design-for-debug features. The experimental evaluation performed
  on a Intel Pentium Core i7-950 demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.
