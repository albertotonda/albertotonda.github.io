abstract: Diversity of food systems and their interaction with the environment has
  become a research topic for many years. Scientists use various models to explain
  environmental issues of food systems. This paper gives an overview of main streams
  in analyzing this topic. A literature review was performed by analyzing published
  scientific papers on environmental impacts in the food chain. The selection criteria
  were focused on different environmental approaches applied in the food chain and
  on the perspectives of future research. This review shows that on the one side there
  are generic environmental models developed by environmental scientists and as such
  applied on food. On the other side, there are models developed by food scientists
  in order to analyze food-environmental interactions. The environmental research
  in food industry can be categorized as product, process or system oriented. This
  study confirmed that the focus of product based approach is mainly performed through
  life-cycle assessments. The process based approach focuses on food processes such
  as heat transfer, cleaning and sanitation and various approaches in food waste management.
  Environmental systems in the food chain were the least investigated stream analyzing
  levels of environmental practices in place. Future research perspectives are the
  emerging challenges related to environmental impacts of novel food processing technologies,
  innovative food packaging and changes in diets and food consumption in connection
  with climate and environmental changes.
