abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely adopted for applications ranging
  from surveillance to environmental monitoring. While powerful and relatively inexpensive,
  they are subject to behavioural faults which make them unreliable. Due to the complex
  interactions between network nodes, it is difficult to uncover faults in a WSN by
  resorting to formal techniques for verification and analysis, or to testing. This
  paper proposes an evolutionary framework to detect anomalous behaviour related to
  energy consumption in WSN routing protocols. Given a collection protocol, the framework
  creates candidate topologies and evaluates them through simulation on the basis
  of metrics measuring the radio activity on nodes. Experimental results using the
  standard Collection Tree Protocol show that the proposed approach is able to unveil
  topologies plagued by excessive energy depletion over one or more nodes, and thus
  could be used as an offline debugging tool to understand and correct the issues
  before network deployment and during the development of new protocols.
