abstract: In many optimization processes, the fitness or the considered measure of
  goodness for the candidate solutions presents uncertainty, that is, it yields different
  values when repeatedly measured, due to the nature of the evaluation process or
  the solution itself. This happens quite often in the context of computational intelligence
  in games, when either bots behave stochastically, or the target game possesses intrinsic
  random elements, but it shows up also in other problems as long as there is some
  random component. Thus, it is important to examine the statistical behavior of repeated
  measurements of performance and, more specifically, the statistical distribution
  that better fits them. This work analyzes four different problems related to computational
  intelligence in videogames, where Evolutionary Computation methods have been applied,
  and the evaluation of each individual is performed by playing the game, and compare
  them to other problem, neural network optimization, where performance is also a
  statistical variable. In order to find possible patterns in the statistical behavior
  of the variables, we track the main features of its distributions, skewness and
  kurtosis. Contrary to the usual assumption in this kind of problems, we prove that,
  in general, the values of two features imply that fitness values do not follow a
  normal distribution; they do present a certain common behavior that changes as evolution
  proceeds, getting in some cases closer to the standard distribution and in others
  drifting apart from it. A clear behavior in this case cannot be concluded, other
  than the fact that the statistical distribution that fitness variables follow is
  affected by selection in different directions, that parameters vary in a single
  generation across them, and that, in general, this kind of behavior will have to
  be taken into account to adequately address uncertainty in fitness in evolutionary
  algorithms.
