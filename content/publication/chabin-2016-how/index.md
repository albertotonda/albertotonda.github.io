abstract: 'The idea of exploiting Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) to make Evolutionary
  Algorithms more effective seems very attractive: intuitively, a probabilistic analysis
  can prove useful to a stochastic optimisation technique. GSA, that gathers information
  about the behaviour of functions receiving some inputs and delivering one or several
  outputs, is based on computationally-intensive stochastic sampling of a parameter
  space. Nevertheless, efficiently exploiting information gathered from GSA might
  not be so straightforward. In this paper, we present three mono- and multi-objective
  counterexamples to prove how naively combining GSA and EA may mislead an optimisation
  process.'
