abstract: "To meet current societal demand for more sustainable transformation processes\
  \ and bioresources, these processes must be optimized and new ones developed. The\
  \ evolution of various systems (raw material, food, or process attributes) can be\
  \ predicted to optimize the uses of biomass for better quality, safety, economic\
  \ benefit, and sustainability. Predictive modeling can guide the necessary changes\
  \ and influence industrials, governmental policies and consumers decision-making.\
  \ However, achieving good predictive capability requires reflection on the models\
  \ and model validation, which can be difficult. This review aims to help scientists\
  \ begin to predict by presenting the techniques currently used in predictive science\
  \ for food and related bioproducts. First, a guideline helps readers initiate a\
  \ prediction process along with final tips and a warning about the risks involved,\
  \ with a particular focus on the crucial validation step. Three broad categories\
  \ of techniques are then presented: empirical, mechanistic, and artificial intelligence\
  \ (or ``data-driven''). For each category, the advantages and limitations of current\
  \ techniques for prediction are explained in light of their current domains of applications,\
  \ illustrated with literature studies and a detailed example. Thus this article\
  \ provides engineering researchers information about predictive modeling which is\
  \ a recent relevant development in optimization of both food and nonfood bioresources\
  \ processes."
