abstract: Caches are crucial components in modern processors (both stand-alone or
  integrated into SoCs) and their test is a challenging task, especially when addressing
  complex and high-frequency devices. While the test of the memory array within the
  cache is usually accomplished resorting to BIST circuitry implementing March test
  inspired solutions, testing the cache controller logic poses some specific issues,
  mainly stemming from its limited accessibility. One possible solution consists in
  letting the processor execute suitable test programs, allowing the detection of
  possible faults by looking at the results they produce. In this paper we face the
  issue of generating suitable programs for testing the replacement logic in set-associative
  caches that implement a deterministic replacement policy. A test program generation
  approach based on modeling the replacement mechanism as a finite state machine (FSM)
  is proposed. Experimental results with a cache implementing a LRU policy are provided
  to assess the effectiveness of the method.
