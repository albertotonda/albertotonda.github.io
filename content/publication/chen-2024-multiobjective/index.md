abstract: The optimal allocation of crops to different parcels of land is a problem
  of paramount practical importance, not only to improve production, but also to address
  the challenges posed by climate change. However, this optimization problem is inherently
  complex, characterized by a vast search space that renders traditional optimization
  techniques impractical without oversimplified assumptions. Compounding this challenge,
  climate change introduces conflicting objectives, as solutions aiming to just maximize
  total yield may be more susceptible to extreme weather events, and thus obtain more
  unpredictable year-by-year outcomes. In order to tackle this complex optimization
  problem, we propose a multi-objective approach, simultaneously maximizing the overall
  yield, minimizing the year-on-year yield variance, and minimizing the total cultivated
  surface. The approach exploits an established multi-objective evolutionary algorithm,
  and employs a machine learning model able to predict yield from weather and soil
  conditions, trained on historical data, making it possible to tackle allocation
  problems of large size. An experimental evaluation focusing on the allocation of
  soybean crops in the European continent for the years 2000-2023 shows that the proposed
  methodology is able to identify different trade-offs between the conflicting objectives,
  that an expert analysis later reveals to be realistic and meaningful for driving
  stakeholder decisions.
