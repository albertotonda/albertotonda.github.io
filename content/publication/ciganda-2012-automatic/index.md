abstract: Test programs for Software-based Self-Test (SBST) can be exploited during
  the mission phase of microprocessor-based systems to periodically assess hardware
  integrity. However, several additional constraints must be imposed due to the coexistence
  of test programs with the mission application. This paper proposes a method for
  the generation of SBST on-line test programs for embedded RISC processors, systems
  where the impact of on-line constraints is significant. The proposed strategy exploits
  an evolutionary optimizer that is able to create a complete test set of programs
  relying on a new cooperative scheme. Experimental results showed high fault coverage
  values on two different modules of a MIPS-like processor core. These two case studies
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique and the low human effort required
  for its implementation.
