abstract: Consumer demand is constantly evolving, and in recent years plant-based
  diets are becoming more appealing to the general public. However, consumers' preferences
  evolve at different speeds, integrating environmental concerns, health considerations,
  and ethical issues. It is therefore important to be able to identify and separate
  trends in demand among the general public. From the data collected through a survey
  of 1,715 respondents in France, concerning priorities, preferences, and drivers
  of change in food choice, we performed an in-depth analysis through machine learning
  techniques such as clustering and classification. While 40% of the interviewed reported
  that their current diet is different from their ideal, and 98% of them wished to
  reduce their consumption of animal products, our analysis revealed several salient
  variables that characterize different classes of individuals. For example, the willingness
  to change the diet is stronger for the younger population, while the main obstacles
  against adopting a plant-based diet are food pleasure, health concerns, and to a
  lesser extent social resistance and animal ethics. From the analysis, it seems that
  environmental concerns are the main motivation especially for people that reduce
  their consumption of animal products in a less radical way.
