abstract: The apparent simplicity of food processes often hides complex systems, where
  physical, chemical and living organisms’ processes co-exist and interact to create
  the final product. Data can be plagued by uncertainty; heterogeneity of available
  information is likely; qualitative and quantitative data may also coexist in the
  same process, from expert perception of food quality to nano-properties of ingredients.
  In order to obtain reliable models, it then becomes necessary to acquire additional
  information from external sources. Experts of a domain can provide invaluable insight
  in products and processes, but this precious knowledge is often available only in
  the form of intuition and implicit expertise. Including expert insight in a model
  can be tackled by having humans interacting with a machine learning process, through
  visualization or via specialists in encoding implicit domain knowledge. In this
  chapter, three selected case studies in food science portray different success stories
  of combining machine learning and expert interaction. We show that expert knowledge
  can be integrated at different stages of the modelling process, either online or
  offline, to initialize, enrich or guide this process.
