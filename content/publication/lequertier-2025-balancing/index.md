abstract: The metabolic fluxes in cells are regulated by metabolites that bind to
  enzymes and modulate their activities. Metabolites can stabilize their own concentrations
  by exerting a negative feedback on their production pathways. Although metabolic
  networks have been studied extensively, many regulation arrows remain unknown. To
  model the costs and benefits of direct enzyme regulation, we apply multi-objective
  optimization with one loss function describing how regulation stabilizes the metabolic
  state against random perturbations and another loss function scoring the extra enzyme
  amounts required by regulation arrows. Using the number of arrows as a third objective
  for ease of interpretation, we study how activating and inhibiting arrows should
  be arranged in the system. Using an evolutionary multi-objective approach, simulating
  an evolution under biological trade-offs, we explore optimal arrow configurations.
  Our framework can also be used with other biological objectives, including optimal
  adaptation or information transmission in metabolic networks, to study their trade-offs
  with objectives such as energy or enzyme investment in cells.
