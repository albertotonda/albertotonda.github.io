 abstract = {This chapter provides preliminary details about nature-inspired computing and optimization techniques. It starts by describing different components of optimization problems and their taxonomy. Nature-inspired computing techniques, created to solve such optimization problems, are then discussed. The chapter briefs the application prospects of nature-inspired optimization techniques in a few representative emerging domains that are covered in the book. Applications presented in this book cover five major domains, which include Controller and Power Systems, Ecological and Economic Systems, Information and Computational Systems, Communication and Networking Systems, and Deep Learning and Neural Networking Systems. The book primarily focuses on the practical challenges that are faced while applying nature-inspired algorithms to different problems in these domains, which include the feasibility of the problem, control parameters and constraints, representation of the solution space, and design of the objective function. Lastly, the chapter concluded by highlighting common challenges, criticisms, and future perspectives.},
