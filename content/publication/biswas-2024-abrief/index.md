abstract: This chapter provides preliminary details about nature-inspired computing
  and optimization techniques. It starts by describing different components of optimization
  problems and their taxonomy. Nature-inspired computing techniques, created to solve
  such optimization problems, are then discussed. The chapter briefs the application
  prospects of nature-inspired optimization techniques in a few representative emerging
  domains that are covered in the book. Applications presented in this book cover
  five major domains, which include Controller and Power Systems, Ecological and Economic
  Systems, Information and Computational Systems, Communication and Networking Systems,
  and Deep Learning and Neural Networking Systems. The book primarily focuses on the
  practical challenges that are faced while applying nature-inspired algorithms to
  different problems in these domains, which include the feasibility of the problem,
  control parameters and constraints, representation of the solution space, and design
  of the objective function. Lastly, the chapter concluded by highlighting common
  challenges, criticisms, and future perspectives.
