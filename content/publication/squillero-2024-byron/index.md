abstract: This paper describes Byron, an evolutionary fuzzer of assembly-language
  programs for the test and verification of programmable devices. Candidate solutions
  are internally encoded as typed, directed multigraphs, that is, graphs where multiple
  edges can connect the same pair of vertexes, with an added layer that defines the
  type of information vertexes can hold, and constraints the possible kinds of edges.
  Multiple genetic operators and a self-adaptation mechanism make the tool ready to
  tackle industrial problems.
