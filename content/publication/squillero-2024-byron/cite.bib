 abstract = {This paper describes Byron, an evolutionary fuzzer of assembly-language programs for the test and verification of programmable devices. Candidate solutions are internally encoded as typed, directed multigraphs, that is, graphs where multiple edges can connect the same pair of vertexes, with an added layer that defines the type of information vertexes can hold, and constraints the possible kinds of edges. Multiple genetic operators and a self-adaptation mechanism make the tool ready to tackle industrial problems.},
