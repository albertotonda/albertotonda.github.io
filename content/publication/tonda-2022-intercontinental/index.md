abstract: This paper investigates to what extent food safety is perceived as a concern
  at the household level in different countries. It aims to identify the factors that
  best explain food safety concern, among the various food-related questions asked
  through a survey. To do so, a machine learning approach is used. The results show
  that the most significant explanatory variables of safety concern are the estimates
  of carbon footprints and calories associated with food products and primarily with
  beef and chicken meat. These results tend to indicate that people who are most concerned
  about food safety are also those who are best aware of environmental and nutritional
  impacts of food.
