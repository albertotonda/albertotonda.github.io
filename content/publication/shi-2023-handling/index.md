abstract: "Context: Managing land use to promote an ecosystem service (ES) without
  reducing others is challenging. The spatial scale at which no-loss constraints are
  imposed is relevant. Objectives: We examined the influence of the spatial scale
  of no-loss constraints on ESs when one ES was optimised. Specifically, we investigated
  how carbon sequestration could be maximized at different spatial scales in France
  with constraints of no-loss on other ESs. Methods: We used a statistical model linking
  land use and land cover variables to ESs [carbon sequestration (CS), crop production
  (CP), livestock production, timber growth] in French small agricultural regions
  (SARs). We optimised CS at the country scale posing no-loss constraints on other
  ESs at increasing spatial scales, i.e., SARs (scenario ``SARs''), department (``DEP''),
  administrative region (``REG''), and France (``FRANCE''). We analysed differences
  between optimized and initial configurations. Results: Optimized CS at the country
  scale increased with the spatial scale at which no-loss constraints were posed (+0.51%
  for DEP and +2.05% for FRANCE). The variability of ES variation among the SARs similarly
  increased. This suggested that constraints at larger scales lead to ES segregation.
  Correlations among ES variations changed with the scenarios (Spearman’s $h̊o$ between
  CS and CP was -0.43 for DEP and -0.70 for FRANCE). This indicated that different
  land use strategies produce different degrees of enhancement/softening of ES trade-offs/synergies.
  Conclusions: A trade-off was highlighted: larger spatial scales promoted better
  performance of the target ES but also spatial inequality. We argue that addressing
  smaller scales will lead to land-sharing solutions that avoid the local environmental
  impacts of land-sparing strategies."
