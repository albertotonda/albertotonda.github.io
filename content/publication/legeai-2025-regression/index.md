abstract: This study presents a novel approach for the automatic optimization of sizing
  French vertical flow wetlands, a widely used solution in wastewater treatment across
  France, with over 6,000 operational units. By leveraging a comprehensive database
  collected by the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment
  (INRAE), we have developed robust regression models that link total Kjeldahl nitrogen
  to surface and total chemical oxygen demand to material depth. By integrating these
  models into a unified optimization framework, our methodology enhances the design
  of the entire treatment train, particularly addressing how the sizing of the first
  stage influences the second stage sizing while complying with stringent effluent
  quality standards. Extensive validation confirms the effectiveness and reliability
  of our approach, which is tailored to specific influent characteristics and regulatory
  requirements. Our strategy improves upon traditional sizing methods, which often
  rely on surface loads, by allowing for refined optimization based on specific performance
  targets. The findings contribute to improved design practices and suggest potential
  directions for future developments, including the integration of additional treatment
  processes and multi-criteria decision analysis for broader applicability in wastewater
  management.
