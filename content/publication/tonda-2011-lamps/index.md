abstract: We present an analysis of the behaviour of Cooperative Co-evolution algorithms
  (CCEAs) on a simple test problem, that is the optimal placement of a set of lamps
  in a square room, for various problems sizes. Cooperative Co-evolution makes it
  possible to exploit more efficiently the artificial Darwinism scheme, as soon as
  it is possible to turn the optimisation problem into a co-evolution of interdependent
  sub-parts of the searched solution. We show here how two cooperative strategies,
  Group Evolution (GE) and Parisian Evolution (PE) can be built for the lamps problem.
  An experimental analysis then compares a classical evolution to GE and PE, and analyses
  their behaviour with respect to scale.
