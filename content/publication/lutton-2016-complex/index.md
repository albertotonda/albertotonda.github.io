abstract: Building in-silico decision making systems is essential in the food domain,
  albeit highly difficult. This task strongly relies on multidisciplinary research
  and in particular on advanced techniques from artificial intelligence. The success
  of such systems depends on how well they cope with the complex properties of food
  processes, such as the large variety of interacting components including those related
  to human expertise; and their dynamic, non-linear, multi-scale, uncertain and non-equilibrium
  behaviors. Robust stochastic optimization techniques, evolutionary computation and
  in particular Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) seem to be a fruitful framework
  for developing food science models. A Human-Centered approach to Interactive Evolutionary
  Computation is discussed in this paper as a possible pertinent way to cope with
  challenges related to human factors in this context.
