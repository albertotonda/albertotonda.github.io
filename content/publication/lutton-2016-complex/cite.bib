 abstract = {Building in-silico decision making systems is essential in the food domain, albeit highly difficult. This task strongly relies on multidisciplinary research and in particular on advanced techniques from artificial intelligence. The success of such systems depends on how well they cope with the complex properties of food processes, such as the large variety of interacting components including those related to human expertise; and their dynamic, non-linear, multi-scale, uncertain and non-equilibrium behaviors. Robust stochastic optimization techniques, evolutionary computation and in particular Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) seem to be a fruitful framework for developing food science models. A Human-Centered approach to Interactive Evolutionary Computation is discussed in this paper as a possible pertinent way to cope with challenges related to human factors in this context.},
