abstract: Multi-criteria reverse engineering (MRE) has arisen from the cross-fertilization
  of advances in mathematics and shifts in social demand. MRE, thus, marks a progressive
  switch (a) from empirical to formal approaches able to simultaneously factor in
  diverse parameters, such as environment, economics, and health; (b) from mono-criterion
  optimization to multi-criteria decision analysis; (c) from forward engineering,
  observing the results of process conditions, to reverse engineering, selecting the
  right process conditions for a target output. The food sector has been slow to adopt
  reverse engineering, but interest is surging now that the industry is looking to
  shift production towards personalized food. MRE has followed a heterogeneous development
  trajectory and found applications in different disciplines. The scope of this review
  spans MRE applications in the food sector covering food packaging and food consumption
  and focuses on demonstrating potentialities of MRE in a complex field like food.
  We explain how MRE enables the development of sustainable processes, looking at
  similar approaches used in sectors other than food. Building on this extensive review,
  we sketch out some guidelines on approaches to be used in future MRE applications
  in food, working up from the problem statement.
