abstract: Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a relatively recent addition
  to the field of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). LSTM networks are specifically
  tailored for machine learning of time series, where the outputs of a system are
  not just a function of their inputs, but also of a internal state. The state itself
  can be seen as dependent on the historical series of all inputs seen by the system
  up to that point in time. In this paper, we present an application of LSTM networks
  to the modeling of biscuit baking. Starting from 16 real-world time series of biscuit
  baking, gathered by the United Biscuits company under different conditions, we show
  how the proposed LSTM network can correctly predict unseen values. Remarkably, the
  network is also able to reproduce a dynamic behavior up to variations that might
  be overlooked as noise.
