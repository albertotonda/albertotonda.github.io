abstract: 'One of the most relevant problems in social networks is influence maximization,
  that is the problem of finding the set of the most influential nodes in a network,
  for a given influence propagation model. As the problem is NP-hard, recent works
  have attempted to solve it by means of computational intelligence approaches, for
  instance Evolutionary Algorithms. However, most of these methods are of limited
  applicability for real-world large-scale networks, for two reasons: on the one hand,
  they require a large number of candidate solution evaluations to converge; on the
  other hand, each evaluation is computationally expensive in that it needs a considerable
  number of Monte Carlo simulations to obtain reliable values. In this work, we consider
  a possible solution to such limitations, by evaluating a surrogate-assisted Multi-Objective
  Evolutionary Algorithm that uses an approximate model of influence propagation (instead
  of Monte Carlo simulations) to find the minimum-sized set of most influential nodes.
  Experiments carried out on two social networks datasets suggest that approximate
  models should be carefully considered before using them in influence maximization
  approaches, as the errors induced by these models are in some cases too big to benefit
  the algorithmic performance.'
