abstract: System identification is the task of automatically learning the model of
  a dynamical system, which can be represented as a system of ordinary differential
  equations (ODEs), using data points from time-series trajectories. This challenge
  has been addressed through various methods, including sparse regression, specialized
  neural networks, and symbolic regression. Applying standard symbolic regression,
  however, requires transforming trajectory data to frame the problem as learning
  a set of regular equations. This study presents a first thorough comparison of the
  two most common data transformation approaches for system identification, evaluating
  their performance on a recently published benchmark suite of ODE systems. Our findings
  reveal that both approaches are highly sensitive to even moderate amounts of added
  noise, to different degrees. More surprisingly, we also show that data transformations
  can generate misleading search spaces, even under noise-free conditions.
