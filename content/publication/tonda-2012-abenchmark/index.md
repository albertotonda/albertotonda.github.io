abstract: 'Cooperative co-evolution algorithms (CCEA) are a thriving sub-field of
  evolutionary computation. This class of algorithms makes it possible to exploit
  more efficiently the artificial Darwinist scheme, as soon as an optimisation problem
  can be turned into a co-evolution of interdependent sub-parts of the searched solution.
  Testing the efficiency of new CCEA concepts, however, it is not straightforward:
  while there is a rich literature of benchmarks for more traditional evolutionary
  techniques, the same does not hold true for this relatively new paradigm. We present
  a benchmark problem designed to study the behavior and performance of CCEAs, modeling
  a search for the optimal placement of a set of lamps inside a room. The relative
  complexity of the problem can be adjusted by operating on a single parameter. The
  fitness function is a trade-off between conflicting objectives, so the performance
  of an algorithm can be examined by making use of different metrics. We show how
  three different cooperative strategies, Parisian Evolution, Group Evolution and
  Allopatric Group Evolution, can be applied to the problem. Using a Classical Evolution
  approach as comparison, we analyse the behavior of each algorithm in detail, with
  respect to the size of the problem.'
