abstract: 'Obtaining reliable in-silico food models is fundamental for a better understanding
  of these systems. The complex phenomena involved in these real-world processes reflect
  in the intricate structure of models, so that thoroughly exploring their behaviour
  and, for example, finding meaningful correlations between variables, become a relevant
  challenge for the experts. In this paper, we present a methodology based on visualisation
  and evolutionary computation to assist experts during model exploration. The proposed
  approach is tested on an established model of milk gel structures, and we show how
  experts are eventually able to find a correlation between two parameters, previously
  considered independent. Reverse-engineering the final outcome, the emergence of
  such a pattern is proved by physical laws underlying the oil–water interface colonisation.
  It is interesting to notice that, while the present work is focused on milk gel
  modelling, the proposed methodology can be straightforwardly generalised to other
  complex physical phenomena. Industrial relevance: Sustainability is nowadays at
  the heart of industrial requirements. The development of mathematical approaches
  should facilitate common approaches to risk/benefit assessment and nutritional quality
  in food research and industry. These models will enhance knowledge on process–structure–property
  relationships from the molecular to macroscopic level, and facilitate the creation
  of in-silico simulators with functional and nutritional properties. The stochastic
  optimisation techniques (evolutionary algorithms) employed in these works allow
  the users to thoroughly explore the systems: when coupled with visualisation, they
  make it possible to provide the experts with a restricted set of significant data,
  helping them to highlight eventual issues or possible improvements in the model.
  With regard to the complexity of the food systems and dynamics, the challenge of
  the mathematical approaches is to realise a complete dynamic description of food
  processing. In order to reach this objective, it is mandatory to use innovative
  strategies, exploiting the most recent advances in cognitive and complex system
  sciences.'
