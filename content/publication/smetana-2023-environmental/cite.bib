 abstract = {Insects can address sustainability issues associated with current food systems by providing an alternative protein source to address hunger and disease. Only the production systems that rely on side-stream heat and alternate energy sources may benefit from replacing compound feed production with insect value chains. 75% percent to 93% of the effects of compound feed production on global warming potential, land use, and fossil resource shortages can be avoided. To fully assess the potential of insect production, it is critical to consider a wide range of sustainability indicators, including social, economic, and environmental aspects.},
