abstract: Insects can address sustainability issues associated with current food systems
  by providing an alternative protein source to address hunger and disease. Only the
  production systems that rely on side-stream heat and alternate energy sources may
  benefit from replacing compound feed production with insect value chains. 75% percent
  to 93% of the effects of compound feed production on global warming potential, land
  use, and fossil resource shortages can be avoided. To fully assess the potential
  of insect production, it is critical to consider a wide range of sustainability
  indicators, including social, economic, and environmental aspects.
