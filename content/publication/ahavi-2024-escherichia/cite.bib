 abstract = {A reservoir based on bacterial metabolism can perform complex computational tasks (solve machine learning problems) at low cost for the cell (no circuit constructed) in an easy-to-use framework. Combining the unique features of living systems with physical reservoir computing could have potential applications in diagnostics and prognosis.},
