abstract: A reservoir based on bacterial metabolism can perform complex computational
  tasks (solve machine learning problems) at low cost for the cell (no circuit constructed)
  in an easy-to-use framework. Combining the unique features of living systems with
  physical reservoir computing could have potential applications in diagnostics and
  prognosis.
