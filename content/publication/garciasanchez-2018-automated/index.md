abstract: 'Collectible card games have been among the most popular and profitable
  products of the entertainment industry since the early days of Magic: The GatheringTM
  in the nineties. Digital versions have also appeared, with HearthStone: Heroes of
  WarCraftTM being one of the most popular. In Hearthstone, every player can play
  as a hero, from a set of nine, and build his/her deck before the game from a big
  pool of available cards, including both neutral and hero-specific cards. This kind
  of games offers several challenges for researchers in artificial intelligence since
  they involve hidden information, unpredictable behaviour, and a large and rugged
  search space. Besides, an important part of player engagement in such games is a
  periodical input of new cards in the system, which mainly opens the door to new
  strategies for the players. Playtesting is the method used to check the new card
  sets for possible design flaws, and it is usually performed manually or via exhaustive
  search; in the case of Hearthstone, such test plays must take into account the chosen
  hero, with its specific kind of cards. In this paper, we present a novel idea to
  improve and accelerate the playtesting process, systematically exploring the space
  of possible decks using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). This EA creates HearthStone
  decks which are then played by an AI versus established human-designed decks. Since
  the space of possible combinations that are play-tested is huge, search through
  the space of possible decks has been shortened via a new heuristic mutation operator,
  which is based on the behaviour of human players modifying their decks. Results
  show the viability of our method for exploring the space of possible decks and automating
  the play-testing phase of game design. The resulting decks, that have been examined
  for balancedness by an expert player, outperform human-made ones when played by
  the AI; the introduction of the new heuristic operator helps to improve the obtained
  solutions, and basing the study on the whole set of heroes shows its validity through
  the whole range of decks.'
