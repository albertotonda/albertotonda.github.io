abstract: Grape berry ripening is a complex process, and predicting the quality of
  wine starting from the ripening kinetics of grape berries is a challenging task.
  To tackle this problem, we present a decision-support system based on coupling expert
  know-how with probability laws encapsulated in a probabilistic model, a dynamic
  Bayesian network. The proposed approach predicts the ripening kinetics of grape
  berries starting from initial measurements and weather conditions, and then exploits
  the information to evaluate the potential of the wine that will produced from them.
  The results show that the dynamic Bayesian network predicts the total acidity concentration
  and the sugar content of the grape berries with a small amount of error (mean of
  6% for total acidity concentration, 10% for sugar content) that is considered satisfying
  by the experts, making it possible to predict the ideal moment for harvesting the
  grapes up to two weeks in advance. Moreover, feeding the results from the probabilistic
  model to a fuzzy expert model, the predicted trajectories are compared to an ideal
  trajectory described by wine experts and formalized mathematically. From this comparison,
  it is possible to anticipate drifts in wine sensory quality right from the step
  of grape ripening.
