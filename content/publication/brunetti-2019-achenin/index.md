abstract: "
The grape berries maturation is a complex process relying on physicochemical and biochemical reactions. These reactions depend on multiple factors of which the climate is the most influential, especially in the last weeks preceding the harvest. Since berries maturity plays a major role in determining wine potentialities, to anticipate the maturation process and determine the right harvesting date is a significant challenge for the wine industry. Different indicators to evaluate the maturation state can be considered, which might be chemical, and thus exactly measurable as the content of sugar, or sensory characteristics, as the seeds color, which requires an expert evaluation on a symbolic ordinated scale.

In this work we present a mathematical model able to predict the maturation process, considering both chemical and sensory indicators, by observing the weather conditions. The predicted indicators’ values are then used to evaluate the wine potentialities, according to the winemaker target. 

We first built a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), which allows us to obtain reliable dynamic predictions of sugar, total acidity, and malic acid, as well as of a selection of sensory indicators, by observing air temperature, rain fall, relative humidity and sunshine hours in the last three weeks preceding the harvest.

Since DBN models require discrete variables and the preliminary discretization process might be a complex and time-consuming task, we developed a semi-automatic discretization technique merging human knowledge and automatic optimization, which not only simplifies the discretization task, but also improves the DBN results.   

Once we predict the maturation indicators, we evaluate the wine potentialities according to the winemaker expectation, by means of a Fuzzy Logic model, linking the maturity indicators to global wine quality."
