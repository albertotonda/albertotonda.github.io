abstract: Several machine learning paradigms have been applied to financial forecasting,
  attempting to predict the marketâ€™s behavior, with the final objective of profiting
  from trading shares. While anticipating the performance of such a complex system
  is far from trivial, this issue becomes even harder when the investors do not have
  large amounts of money available. In this paper, we present an evolutionary portfolio
  optimizer for the management of small budgets. The expected returns are modeled
  resorting to Multi-layer Perceptrons, trained on past market data, and the portfolio
  composition is chosen by approximating the solution to a multi-objective constrained
  problem. An investment simulator is then used to measure the portfolio performance.
  The proposed approach is tested on real-world data from Milan stock exchange, exploiting
  information from January 2000 to June 2010 to train the framework, and data from
  July 2010 to August 2011 to validate it. The presented tool is finally proven able
  to obtain a more than satisfying profit for the considered time frame.
