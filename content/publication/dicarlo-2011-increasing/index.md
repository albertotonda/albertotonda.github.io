abstract: Artificial olfaction systems, which mimic human olfaction by using arrays
  of gas chemical sensors combined with pattern recognition methods, represent a potentially
  low-cost tool in many areas of industry such as perfumery, food and drink production,
  clinical diagnosis, health and safety, environmental monitoring and process control.
  However, successful applications of these systems are still largely limited to specialized
  laboratories. Sensor drift, i.e., the lack of a sensor’s stability over time, still
  limits real industrial setups. This paper presents and discusses an evolutionary
  based adaptive drift-correction method designed to work with state-of-the-art classification
  systems. The proposed approach exploits a cutting-edge evolutionary strategy to
  iteratively tweak the coefficients of a linear transformation which can transparently
  correct raw sensors’ measures thus mitigating the negative effects of the drift.
  The method learns the optimal correction strategy without the use of models or other
  hypotheses on the behavior of the physical chemical sensors.
