abstract: Unlike other digestive proteases, pepsin specificity is low. It is therefore
  particularly difficult to determine a priori which peptides will be released during
  gastric digestion, and hence in the small intestine. Detailed information about
  food protein truncation during digestion is however critical to understanding and
  optimizing the availability of bioactives, or limiting allergen release. A stochastic
  model that dynamically simulates the nature and quantity of peptides that are likely
  to be produced during pepsin hydrolysis is presented. Model predictions are compared
  with experimental data taken from (Grosvenor et al. 2014), which includes a list
  of 89 monitored peptides arising from pepsin hydrolysis of bovine lactoferrin.
