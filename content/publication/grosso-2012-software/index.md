abstract: 'Software-based self-testing strategies have been mainly proposed to tackle
  microprocessor testing, but may also be applied to peripheral testing. However,
  testing system peripherals (e.g., DMA controllers, interrupt controllers, and internal
  counters) is a challenging task, since their observability and controllability are
  even more reduced when compared to microprocessors and to peripherals devoted to
  I/O communication (e.g., serial or parallel ports). In this paper an approach to
  develop functional tests for system peripherals is proposed. The presented methodology
  requires two correlated phases: module configuration and module operation. The first
  one prepares the peripheral to work in the different operation modes, whereas the
  second one is in charge of exciting the whole device and observing its behavior.
  We propose a methodology that guides the test engineer in building a compact set
  of test programs able to reach high structural fault coverage levels in a short
  time. Experimental results demonstrating the method effectiveness for two real-world
  case studies are finally reported.'
