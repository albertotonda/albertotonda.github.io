abstract: 'The backlash is a lost motion in a mechanism created by gaps between its
  parts. It causes vibrations that increase over time and negatively affect accuracy
  and performance. The quickest and most precise way to measure the backlash is to
  use specific sensors, that have to be added to the standard equipment of the robot.
  However, this solution is little used in practice because raises the manufacturing
  costs. An alternative solution can be to exploit a virtual sensor, i.e., the information
  about phenomena that are not directly measured is reconstructed by signals from
  sensors used for other measurements.This work evaluates the use of bio-inspired
  swarm algorithms as the processing core of a virtual sensor for the backlash of
  a robotic joint. Swarm-based approaches, with their relatively modest occupation
  of memory and low computational load, could be ideal candidates to solve the problem.
  In this paper, we exploit four state-of-the-art swarm-based optimization algorithms:
  the Dragonfly Algorithm, the Ant Lion Optimizer, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm,
  and the Grey Wolf Optimizer. The four candidate algorithms are compared on 20 different
  datasets covering a range of backlash values that reflect an industrial case scenario.
  Numerical results indicate that, unfortunately, none of the algorithms considered
  provides satisfactory solutions for the problem analyzed. Therefore, even if promising,
  these algorithms cannot represent the final choice for the problem of interest.'
