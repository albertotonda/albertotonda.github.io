abstract: 'As the COVID-19 pandemic winds down, it leaves behind the serious concern
  that future, even more disruptive pandemics may eventually surface. One of the crucial
  steps in handling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was being able to detect the presence
  of the virus in an accurate and timely manner, to then develop policies counteracting
  the spread. Nevertheless, as the pandemic evolved, new variants with potentially
  dangerous mutations appeared. Faced by these developments, it becomes clear that
  there is a need for fast and reliable techniques to create highly specific molecular
  tests, able to uniquely identify VOCs. Using an automated pipeline built around
  evolutionary algorithms, we designed primer sets for SARS-CoV-2 (main lineage) and
  for VOC, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron). Starting from sequences openly
  available in the GISAID repository, our pipeline was able to deliver the primer
  sets for the main lineage and each variant in a matter of hours. Preliminary in-silico
  validation showed that the sequences in the primer sets featured high accuracy.
  A pilot test in a laboratory setting confirmed the results: the developed primers
  were favorably compared against existing commercial versions for the main lineage,
  and the specific versions for the VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.529 were clinically tested
  successfully.'
