abstract: 'Due to the relatively recent history of industrial insect farming, there
  are still no extensive studies on the optimization of insect production chains.
  In this context, the present work aims to be a first step in filling this gap. A
  tentative set of mathematical models is proposed to take into account three different,
  conflicting objectives: maximizing economic viability, minimizing environmental
  impacts, and maximizing societal benefits. The state-of-the-art multi-objective
  algorithm NSGA-II is used to obtain an approximate Pareto fronts of solutions, that
  are later analyzed to identify suitable trade-offs. While preliminary, the results
  are encouraging enough for the computer-assisted design and development of sustainable
  insect production chains. Future works will take into account more extensive models,
  able to simulate scenarios in different European countries, and include parts of
  the chain such as transportation of goods to and from the production facilities.'
