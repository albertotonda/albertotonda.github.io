abstract: Biocomputing has emerged as a promising field with the potential for energy-efficient
  computation, but standardized methods to evaluate living systems’ problem-solving
  capabilities remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, we focus on bacterial systems
  and their metabolic adaptation. Using an in-silico model of bacterial behavior in
  varying environments, we propose a new framework for transforming supervised machine
  learning (ML) problems into a format solvable by biological systems. We then evaluate
  the framework’s performance against other ML algorithms on standard classification
  and regression benchmarks. Experimental results show that bacterial metabolic networks
  often outperform linear methods and rival boosted trees, which are considered state-of-the-art
  for tabular data. A final ablation study suggests that the system’s computational
  capacity may stem from its biological components rather than the translation tools
  used for the learning problem.
