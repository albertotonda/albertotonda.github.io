abstract: "Program Trace Optimization (PTO) is a framework that provides automatic
  representation design for arbitrary problem structures by separating problem specification
  from search algorithm application. Problems in PTO are specified through two components:
  a generator that creates candidate solutions and a fitness function that evaluates
  them. A key strength of PTO is its ability to work with unrestricted programs as
  generators. We explore PTO's application to sophisticated generators based on language
  models, using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) as our case study. Our
  results demonstrate how PTO can effectively search the space of programs generated
  by language models trained on domain-specific languages, with context-aware operators
  that automatically preserve the model's statistical patterns during evolutionary
  search. This work shows how PTO can seamlessly incorporate advanced generative methods
  without requiring modification of the underlying search algorithms."
