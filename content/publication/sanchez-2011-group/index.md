abstract: A huge number of optimization problems, in the CAD area as well as in many
  other fields, require a solution composed by a set of structurally homogeneous elements.
  Each element tackles a subset of the original task, and they cumulatively solve
  the whole problem. Sub-tasks, however, have exactly the same structure, and the
  splitting is completely arbitrary. Even the number of sub-tasks is not known and
  cannot be determined a-priori. Individual elements are structurally homogeneous,
  and their contribution to the main solution can be evaluated separately. We propose
  an evolutionary algorithm able to optimize groups of individuals for solving this
  class of problems. An individual of the best solution may be sub-optimal when considered
  alone, but the set of individuals cumulatively represent the optimal group able
  to completely solve the whole problem. Results of preliminary experiments show that
  our algorithm performs better than other techniques commonly applied in the CAD
  field.
