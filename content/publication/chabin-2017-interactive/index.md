abstract: Modelling the production and stabilisation process of lactic acid starters
  has several practical applications, ranging from assessing the efficacy of new industrial
  methods, to proposing alternative sustainable systems of food production. In order
  to reach this objective, however, it is necessary to overcome several obstacles,
  tied to the complex nature and interactions of the target processes. In this paper,
  we present a novel complex system modelling approach, exploiting both stand-alone
  evolutionary search and visual interaction with the user. The presented framework
  is then tested on a real-world case study, for which it shows promising results.
