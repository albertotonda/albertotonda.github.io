abstract: We propose an unsupervised, model-agnostic, wrapper method for feature selection.
  We assume that if a feature can be predicted using the others, it adds little information
  to the problem, and therefore could be removed without impairing the performance
  of whatever model will be eventually built. The proposed method iteratively identifies
  and removes predictable, or nearly-predictable, redundant features, allowing to
  trade-off complexity with expected quality. The approach do not rely on target labels
  nor values, and the model used to identify predictable features is not related to
  the final use of the feature set. Therefore, it can be used for supervised, unsupervised,
  or semi-supervised problems, or even as a safe, pre-processing step to improve the
  quality of the results of other feature selection techniques. Experimental results
  against state-of-the-art feature-selection algorithms show satisfying performance
  on several non-trivial benchmarks.
