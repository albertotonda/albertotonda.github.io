abstract: One of the biggest challenges today is to satisfy an increasing food demand
  while preserving ecosystem services. Farming systems have a huge impact on land
  cover and land use, it is therefore vital to understand how land cover and land
  use allocation can promote synergies between food production and other ecosystem
  services. Livestock production has multiple interactions with other ecosystem services
  and can promote synergies especially in grasslands. We investigated the interactions
  between livestock production and other ecosystem services and explored strategies
  to soften trade-offs and enhance synergies. We considered four ecosystem services
  (livestock production, crop production, carbon sequestration, and timber growth)
  in France. We considered 709 land units covering a wide range of farming systems
  where both food production and other ecosystem services are provided. For each land
  unit, we built ecological production functions that are models measuring the statistical
  influence of driving variables (i.e. land cover, land use, pesticide expense, and
  climate) on the provision of ecosystem services. Using an optimization procedure,
  we studied the extent to which livestock production could be increased without reducing
  other ecosystem services and without increasing total pesticide expense. We found
  that a 20% increase in livestock production could be achieved by all farming systems
  in France under those general constraints. The 709 land units could be grouped based
  on similar combinations of increases or decreases in specific ecosystem services
  during the optimization. 48% of land units were specialised on food production,
  24% were specialised on other ecosystem services, 16% were specialised on the mixed
  provision of food production and other ecosystem services, whereas the remaining
  12% showed decrease or no change in all ecosystem services. Livestock production
  was either in trade-off or in synergy with the other ecosystem services. The trade-offs
  could be softened through intensified use of cultivated land and spatial segregation
  of livestock production. The synergies could be enhanced only through major grassland
  expansion.
