abstract: Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) studies how uncertainty in the inputs
  of a system influences uncertainty in its outputs. GSA is extensively used by experts
  to gather information about the behavior of models, through computationally-intensive
  stochastic sampling of parameters' space. Some studies propose to make use of the
  considerable quantity of data acquired in this way to optimize the model parameters,
  often resorting to Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). Nevertheless, efficiently exploiting
  information gathered from GSA might not be so straightforward. In this paper, we
  present a counterexample followed by experimental results to prove how naively combining
  GSA and EA can bring about negative outcomes.
