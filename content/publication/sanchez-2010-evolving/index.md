abstract: In this paper, we illustrate the use of evolutionary agents in a multi-agent
  system designed to describe the behavior of car drivers. Each agent has the selfish
  objective to reach its destination in the shortest time possible, and a preference
  in terms of paths to take, based on the presence of other agents and on the width
  of the roads. Those parameters are changed with an evolutionary strategy, to mimic
  the adaptation of a human driver to different traffic conditions. The system proposed
  is then tested by giving the agents the ability to perceive the presence of other
  agents in a given radius. Experimental results show that knowing the position of
  all the car drivers in the map leads the agents to obtain a better performance,
  thanks to the evolution of their behavior. Even the system as a whole gains some
  benefits from the evolution of the agents' individual choices.
