abstract: 'Social networks are one the main sources of information transmission nowadays.
  However, not all nodes in social networks are equal: in fact, some nodes are more
  influential than others, i.e., their information tends to spread more. Finding the
  most influential nodes in a network – the so-called Influence Maximization problem
  – is an NP-hard problem with great social and economical implications. Here, we
  introduce a framework based on Evolutionary Algorithms that includes various graph-aware
  techniques (spread approximations, domain-specific operators, and node filtering)
  that facilitate the optimization process. The framework can be applied straightforwardly
  to various social network datasets, e.g., those in the SNAP repository.'
