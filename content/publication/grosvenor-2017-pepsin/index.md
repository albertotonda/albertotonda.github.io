abstract: Pepsin is the first protease encountered within the digestive tract. Unlike
  other digestive proteases, its specificity is low. It is therefore particularly
  difficult to determine a priori which peptides will be released during gastric digestion.
  Detailed information about food protein truncation during digestion is however critical
  to understanding and optimizing the availability of bioactives, or limiting allergen
  release. In this study, a stochastic model which tries to reproduce the dynamics
  of protein hydrolysis by pepsin is presented. The model is based on pepsin cleavage
  frequency tables taken from the literature, and makes use of Monte-Carlo in silico
  simulations to quantitatively predict peptides that are likely to be produced by
  pepsin during the course of the reaction. The proposed model, which requires the
  expected hydrolysis kinetics and the amino-acid sequence of the studied protein
  to run, was applied to bovine lactoferrin. Model predictions were then compared
  with 89 peptides experimentally observed with a peptidomic approach using isobaric
  labelling during 2h gastric digestion experiments (Grosvenor et al., Food and Function,
  2014). The model was found to reproduce many real-world features of the case study,
  such as the relative peptide abundance summary maps along the protein sequence (peptide
  patterns) or peptide size distribution. It even appeared that 50% of experimentally
  observed peptides (45/89) fall within the 164 most abundant predicted peptides (over
  a total of  Ìƒ1500 predicted peptides). These first results illustrate that in silico
  modelling of pepsin hydrolysis is a promising approach to determine which peptides
  are likely to be released during gastric digestion of foods.
