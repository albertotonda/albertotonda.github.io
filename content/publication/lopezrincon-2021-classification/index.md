abstract: In this paper, deep learning is coupled with explainable artificial intelligence
  techniques for the discovery of representative genomic sequences in SARS-CoV-2.
  A convolutional neural network classifier is first trained on 553 sequences from
  the National Genomics Data Center repository, separating the genome of different
  virus strains from the Coronavirus family with 98.73% accuracy. The networkâ€™s behavior
  is then analyzed, to discover sequences used by the model to identify SARS-CoV-2,
  ultimately uncovering sequences exclusive to it. The discovered sequences are validated
  on samples from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Global Initiative
  on Sharing All Influenza Data repositories, and are proven to be able to separate
  SARS-CoV-2 from different virus strains with near-perfect accuracy. Next, one of
  the sequences is selected to generate a primer set, and tested against other state-of-the-art
  primer sets, obtaining competitive results. Finally, the primer is synthesized and
  tested on patient samples (n = 6 previously tested positive), delivering a sensitivity
  similar to routine diagnostic methods, and 100% specificity. The proposed methodology
  has a substantial added value over existing methods, as it is able to both automatically
  identify promising primer sets for a virus from a limited amount of data, and deliver
  effective results in a minimal amount of time. Considering the possibility of future
  pandemics, these characteristics are invaluable to promptly create specific detection
  methods for diagnostics.
