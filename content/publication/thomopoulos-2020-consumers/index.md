abstract: "In the context of global warming and environmental pressure, food chains
  must adapt to new production conditions while satisfying the evolving consumer demand.
  Livestock production is known for its negative ecological footprint, bringing forward
  the question of a possible transition towards more plant-based diets. Citizens'
  demand evolves at different speeds and integrates these new environmental concerns
  sometimes mixed with health or ethical issues. We carried out a survey with 1,715
  respondents in France, about their food choice priorities and preferences, as well
  as the drivers of change. Our results indicate that 40% of respondents claim that
  their current diet is not what they would ideally have and 98% of them would like
  to reduce their animal product consumption. Classification algorithms reveals several
  salient variables separating classes of individuals wishing to shift their food
  diet towards less animal products: the willingness to change is stronger for the
  youngest, factors impacting the willingness to change are food pleasure, health
  and to a lesser extent social resistance and animal ethics. The less radical the
  animal product reduction is, the more environmental concerns become the main motivation."
