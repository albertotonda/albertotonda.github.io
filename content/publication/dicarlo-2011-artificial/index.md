abstract: Artificial Olfaction (AO) is a topical branch of bio-inspired artificial
  intelligence with formidable challenges and potential impacts. Robots equipped with
  Electronic Noses (ENs) could assist humans in detecting toxic gases or explosives.
  Despite progress in the last decade, mimicking human olfaction capabilities remains
  a challenge. ENs could offer a simple, fast, and economic alternative to traditional
  quality control techniques in industries like food processing. However, sensor drift
  is a major limitation, requiring frequent recalibration and incurring high costs.
  Conventional pattern recognition (PaRC) models become ineffective over time, necessitating
  adaptive strategies. In this paper, a novel methodology using Covariance Matrix
  Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) is proposed. CMA-ES is a stochastic optimization
  method inspired by biological evolution that adapts correction parameters in small
  time windows to address drift. The methodology minimizes deviations of drift-corrected
  samples from their training-class centroids. It was validated on experimental data
  from the EOS835 EN prototype, measuring 545 samples of organic vapors. Four classifiers
  —- kNN, PLS, ANN, and Random Forest (RF) —- were tested, with Orthogonal Signal
  Correction (OSC) as a baseline comparison. CMA-ES outperformed OSC, demonstrating
  robust long-term adaptation even with limited data. The findings indicate that CMA-ES
  effectively mitigates drift, providing flexibility across classifiers and ensuring
  reliable performance over time.
