abstract: 'Branch Prediction Units (BPUs) are commonly used in pipelined processors,
  since they can significantly decrease the negative impact of branches in superscalar
  and RISC architectures. Traditional solutions, mainly based on scan, are often inadequate
  to effectively test these modules: in particular, scan does not represent a viable
  solution when Incoming Inspection or on-line test are considered. Functional test
  may stand as an effective solution in these situations, but requires effective algorithms
  to be available. In this paper we propose a functional approach targeting the test
  of BPUs based on the Branch History Table (BHT) architecture; the proposed approach
  is independent on the specific implementation of the BPU, and is thus widely applicable.
  Its effectiveness has been validated on a BPU resorting to an open-source computer
  architecture simulator and to an ad hoc developed HDL testbench. Experimental results
  show that the proposed method is able to thoroughly test the BPU, reaching complete
  static fault coverage with reasonable requirements in terms of test program size
  and execution time.'
