abstract: Microbiome data predictive analysis within a machine learning (ML) workflow
  presents numerous domain-specific challenges involving preprocessing, feature selection,
  predictive modeling, performance estimation, model interpretation, and the extraction
  of biological information from the results. To assist decision-making, we offer
  a set of recommendations on algorithm selection, pipeline creation and evaluation,
  stemming from the COST Action ML4Microbiome. We compared the suggested approaches
  on a multi-cohort shotgun metagenomics dataset of colorectal cancer patients, focusing
  on their performance in disease diagnosis and biomarker discovery. It is demonstrated
  that the use of compositional transformations and filtering methods as part of data
  preprocessing does not always improve the predictive performance of a model. In
  contrast, the multivariate feature selection, such as the Statistically Equivalent
  Signatures algorithm, was effective in reducing the classification error. When validated
  on a separate test dataset, this algorithm in combination with random forest modeling,
  provided the most accurate performance estimates. Lastly, we showed how linear modeling
  by logistic regression coupled with visualization techniques such as Individual
  Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots can yield interpretable results and offer biological
  insights. These findings are significant for clinicians and non-experts alike in
  translational applications.
