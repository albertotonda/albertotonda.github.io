abstract: 'A malicious botnet is a collection of compromised hosts coordinated by
  an external entity. The malicious software, or malware, that infect the systems
  are its basic units and they are responsible for its global behavior. Anti Virus
  software and Intrusion Detection Systems detect botnets by analyzing network and
  files, looking for signature and known behavioral patterns. Thus, the malware hiding
  capability is a crucial aspect. This paper describes a new obfuscation mechanism
  based on evolutionary algorithms: an evolutionary core is embedded in the malware
  to generate a different, optimized hiding strategy for every single infection. Such
  always-changing, hard-to-detect malware can be used by security industries to stress
  the analysis methodologies and to test the ability to react to malware mutations.
  This research is the first step in a more ambitious research project, where a whole
  botnet, composed of different malware and Anti Virus software, is analyzed as a
  prey-predator ecosystem.'
