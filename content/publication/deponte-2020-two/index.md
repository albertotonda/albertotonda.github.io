abstract: Insufficient cleaning in the food industry can create serious hygienic risks.
  However, when attempting to avoid these risks, food-processing plants frequently
  tend to clean for too long, at extremely high temperatures, or with too many chemicals,
  resulting in high cleaning costs and severe environmental impacts. Therefore, the
  optimization of cleaning processes in the food industry has significant economic
  and ecological potential. Unfortunately, in-situ assessments of cleaning processes
  are difficult, and the multitude of different cleaning situations complicates the
  definition of a comprehensive approach. In this study, two methodological approaches
  for the comprehensive modeling of cleaning processes are introduced. The resulting
  models facilitate comparisons of different cleaning processes and they can be scaled
  up for processes with similar conditions, using cleaning time as a response. A dimensional
  analysis is performed to obtain general results and to allow transfer of the approaches
  to other cleaning situations. The models are established according to the statistical
  rules for the deduction of multiple regression equations for the prediction of the
  response based on the input parameters. The terms of the model equation are confirmed
  with a significance analysis. A machine learning approach is also used to create
  model equations with symbolic regression. Both methods and the obtained model equations
  are validated. The two applied approaches reveal similar significant terms and models.
  Significant dimensionless numbers are the Reynolds number, the density number that
  describes the ratio of the density of the soil to the density of the cleaning agent,
  and the soil number, which is a new dimensionless number that characterizes the
  properties of food soils. The methodology of both approaches is transparent; therefore,
  the resulting equations can be compared and similarities are found. Both methods
  are deemed applicable for the computational modeling of cleaning processes in food
  industry.
