abstract: Nature-inspired optimization Algorithms (NIOAs) are nowadays a popular choice
  for community detection in social networks. Community detection problem in social
  network is treated as an optimization problem, where the objective is to either
  maximize the connection within the community or minimize connections between the
  communities. To apply NIOAs, either of the two, or both objectives are explored.
  Since NIOAs mostly exploit randomness in their strategies, it is necessary to analyze
  their performance for specific applications. In this paper, NIOAs are analyzed for
  the community detection problem. A direct comparison approach is followed to perform
  the pairwise comparison of NIOAs. The performance is measured in terms of five scores
  designed based on the prasatul matrix and also with average isolability. Three widely
  used real-world social networks and four NIOAs are considered for analyzing the
  quality of communities generated by NIOAs.
