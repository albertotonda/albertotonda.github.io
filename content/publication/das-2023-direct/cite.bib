 abstract = {Nature-inspired optimization Algorithms (NIOAs) are nowadays a popular choice for community detection in social networks. Community detection problem in social network is treated as an optimization problem, where the objective is to either maximize the connection within the community or minimize connections between the communities. To apply NIOAs, either of the two, or both objectives are explored. Since NIOAs mostly exploit randomness in their strategies, it is necessary to analyze their performance for specific applications. In this paper, NIOAs are analyzed for the community detection problem. A direct comparison approach is followed to perform the pairwise comparison of NIOAs. The performance is measured in terms of five scores designed based on the prasatul matrix and also with average isolability. Three widely used real-world social networks and four NIOAs are considered for analyzing the quality of communities generated by NIOAs.},
