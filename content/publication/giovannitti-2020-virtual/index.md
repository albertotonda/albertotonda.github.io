abstract: Industrial manipulators are robots used to replace humans in dangerous or
  repetitive tasks. Also, these devices are often used for applications where high
  precision and accuracy is required. The increase of backlash caused by wear, that
  is, the increase of the amount by which teeth space exceeds the thickness of gear
  teeth, might be a significant problem, that could lead to impaired performances
  or even abrupt failures. However, maintenance is difficult to schedule because backlash
  cannot be directly measured and its effects only appear in closed loops. This paper
  proposes a novel technique, based on an Evolutionary Algorithm, to estimate the
  increase of backlash in a robot joint transmission. The peculiarity of this method
  is that it only requires measurements from the motor encoder. Experimental evaluation
  on a real-world test case demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.
