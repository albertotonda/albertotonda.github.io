abstract: 'This paper presents a genotype-level distance metric for Genetic Programming
  (GP) based on the symmetric difference concept: first, the information contained
  in individuals is expressed as a set of symbols (the content of each node, its position
  inside the tree, and recurring parent-child structures); then, the difference between
  two individuals is computed considering the number of elements belonging to one,
  but not both, of their symbol sets.'
