abstract: Insect value chains are a complex system with non-linear links between many
  economic, environmental, and social variables. Multi-objective optimization (MOO)
  algorithms for finding optimal options for complex system functioning can provide
  a valuable insight in the development of sustainable insect chains. This review
  proposes a framework for MOO application that is based on gradual implementation,
  beginning with factors that have an immediate impact on insect production (feed
  qualities, resource utilization, yield), and progressing to integrated units (environmental,
  social, and economic impacts). The review introduces the key hotspots of insect
  production chains, which have been developed in suitable MOO objectives. They represent
  aspects of resource use, feed quality and its conversion by insects, labor safety
  and wage fairness, as well as environmental impacts. The capacity of the suggested
  MOO framework to describe all facets of sustainability may have certain limits.
  To determine the frameworkâ€™s applicability and the specific MOO algorithms that
  can perform the function, modeling and further testing on real insect production
  chains would be necessary for the intended objectives.
