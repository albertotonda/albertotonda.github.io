abstract: 'In machine learning a coreset is defined as a subset of the training set
  using which an algorithm obtains performances similar to what it would deliver if
  trained over the whole original data. Advantages of coresets include improving training
  speed and easing human understanding. Coreset discovery is an open line of research
  as limiting the training might also impair the quality of the result. Differently,
  virtual points, here called archetypes, might be far more informative for a machine
  learning algorithm. Starting from this intuition, a novel evolutionary approach
  to archetype set discovery is presented: starting from a population seeded with
  candidate coresets, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is set to modify them
  and eventually create archetype sets, to minimize both number of points in the set
  and classification error. Experimental results on popular benchmarks show that the
  proposed approach is able to deliver results that allow a classifier to obtain lower
  error and better ability of generalizing on unseen data than state-of-the-art coreset
  discovery techniques.'
