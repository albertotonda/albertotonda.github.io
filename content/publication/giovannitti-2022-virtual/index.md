abstract: Gear backlash is a quite serious problem in industrial robots, it causes
  vibrations and impairs the robot positioning accuracy. Backlash estimation allows
  targeted maintenance interventions, preserving robot performances and avoiding unforeseen
  equipment breakdowns. However, a direct measure of the backlash is hard to obtain,
  and dedicated auxiliary sensors are required for the measurement. This paper presents
  a method for estimating backlash in robotic joints that does not require the installation
  of extra devices. It only relies on data gathered from the motor encoder, which
  is always present in a robotic joint. The approach is based on the observation of
  a characteristic vibration pattern arising on the motor speed signal when backlash
  affects the joint transmission. By looking at the amplitude of this vibration some
  information about the entity of the backlash in the joint is gathered. Experimental
  results on simulated data are reported in the study to show the robustness of the
  method, also with respect of noise. Furthermore, tests on real-world data, gathered
  from robots installed in a production plant, demonstrate the efficacy of the technique.
  The approach is cost-effective, fast, and easily automatable, therefore convenient
  for the industrial world.
