abstract: In this work, we propose to use a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm
  to set the discretization thresholds for gene expression profiles, using feedback
  from a classifier in order to maximize the accuracy of the predictions based on
  the discretized gene expression levels, while at the same time minimizing the number
  of different profiles obtained, to ease the understanding of the expert. The methodology
  is applied to a dataset containing COVID-19 patients that developed either mild
  or severe symptoms. The results show that the evolutionary approach performs better
  than a traditional discretization based on statistical analysis, and that it does
  preserve the sense-making necessary for practitioners to trust the results.
