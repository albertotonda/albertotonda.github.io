abstract: 'Todayâ€™s SoCs are composed of a wide variety of modules, such as microprocessor
  cores, memories, peripherals, and customized blocks directly related to the targeted
  application. To effectively perform simulation-based design verification of peripheral
  cores, it is necessary to stimulate the description in a broad range of behavior
  possibilities, checking the produced results. Different strategies for generating
  suitable stimuli have been proposed by the research community to functionally verify
  these modules and their interconnection when embedded in a SoC: however, their verification
  often remains a largely manual and unstructured operation. In this paper we describe
  a general approach to develop concise and effective sets of inputs by modeling the
  configuration modes of a peripheral with a graph, and creating paths able to cover
  all of its nodes: proper stimuli for the device are then directly derived from the
  paths. The resulting inputs sequences are aimed at design verification of system
  peripherals such as DMA controllers, and can be applied via simulation by means
  of dedicated testbenches or by setting up an environment including a processor,
  which executes a proper test priogram. In the latter case, the developed programs
  can be exploited in later stages for testing, by adding suitable observability features.
  Experimental results demonstrating the method effectiveness are reported.'
