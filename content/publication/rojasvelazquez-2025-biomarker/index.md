abstract: Omics data can contain predictive information of the onset of diseases and
  chronic conditions. Applying machine learning (ML) techniques to omics data is a
  promising venue of research, but domain data sets are typically high-dimensional
  and low-sample-size, presenting significant challenges to classic ML approaches.
  Another obstacle is the black-box nature of many ML algorithms, which prevents them
  from being deployed in medical practice. Symbolic regression (SR) is a possible
  solution to obtain human-interpretable models; but even equations cannot be easily
  understood, if they include hundreds or thousands of features. While feature selection
  can help reducing the number of features to be considered, most algorithms make
  unrealistic assumptions or bias the selection using a single classifier. In this
  work, we apply the Recursive Ensemble Feature Selection (REFS) algorithm, designed
  to avoid over-relying on a single ML model, with a modern SR algorithm, to obtain
  interpretable models predictive for different diseases, starting from real-world
  omics data. Experimental results for five different omics studies show that the
  completely open-source approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art in closed-source
  software. Comparing the same pipeline with REFS and more classic feature selection
  techniques shows that models created with REFS have a better performance.
