abstract: Mathematical modelling plays an important role in food engineering having
  various mathematical models tailored for different food topics. However, mathematical
  models are followed by limited information on their application in food companies.
  This paper aims to discuss the extent and the conditions surrounding the usage of
  mathematical models in the context of European food and drinks industry. It investigates
  the knowledge, nature and current use of modelling approaches in relation to the
  industry main characteristics. A total of 203 food companies from 12 European countries
  were included in this research. Results reveal that the country where the company
  operates, and size of the company, are more important predictors on the usage of
  mathematical models followed by the type of food sector. The more developed countries
  are positioned at the higher level of knowledge and use of available models. Similar
  pattern was observed at the micro level showing that small or medium sized companies
  exhibit lack of knowledge, resources and limiting usage of models.
