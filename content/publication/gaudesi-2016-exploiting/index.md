abstract: "The iterated prisoner's dilemma is a famous model of cooperation and conflict
  in game theory. Its origin can be traced back to the Cold War, and countless strategies
  for playing it have been proposed so far, either designed by hand or automatically
  generated by computers. In the 2000s, scholars started focusing on adaptive players,
  that is, able to classify their opponent's behavior and adopt an effective counter-strategy.
  The player presented in this paper, pushes such idea even further: it builds a model
  of the current adversary from scratch, without relying on any pre-defined archetypes,
  and tweaks it as the game develops using an evolutionary algorithm; at the same
  time, it exploits the model to lead the game into the most favorable continuation.
  Models are compact nondeterministic finite state machines; they are extremely efficient
  in predicting opponents' replies, without being completely correct by necessity.
  Experimental results show that such a player is able to win several one-to-one games
  against strong opponents taken from the literature, and that it consistently prevails
  in round-robin tournaments of different sizes."
