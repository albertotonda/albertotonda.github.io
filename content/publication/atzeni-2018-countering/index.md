abstract: Reducing the effort required by humans in countering malware is of utmost
  practical value. We describe a scalable, semi-supervised framework to dig into massive
  data sets of Android applications and identify new malware families. Until 2010,
  the industrial standard for the detection of malicious applications has been mainly
  based on signatures; as each tiny alteration in malware makes them ineffective,
  new signatures are frequently created –- a task that requires a considerable amount
  of time and resources from skilled experts. The framework we propose is able to
  automatically cluster applications in families and suggest formal rules for identifying
  them with 100% recall and quite high precision. The families are used either to
  safely extend experts’ knowledge on new samples or to reduce the number of applications
  requiring thorough analyses. We demonstrated the effectiveness and the scalability
  of the approach running experiments on a database of 1.5 million Android applications.
  In 2018, the framework has been successfully deployed on Koodous, a collaborative
  anti-malware platform.
