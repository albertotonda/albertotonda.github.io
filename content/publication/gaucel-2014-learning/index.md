abstract: 'Symbolic regression has many successful applications in learning free-form
  regular equations from data. Trying to apply the same approach to differential equations
  is the logical next step: so far, however, results have not matched the quality
  obtained with regular equations, mainly due to additional constraints and dependencies
  between variables that make the problem extremely hard to tackle. In this paper
  we propose a new approach to dynamic systems learning. Symbolic regression is used
  to obtain a set of first-order Eulerian approximations of differential equations,
  and mathematical properties of the approximation are then exploited to reconstruct
  the original differential equations. Advantages of this technique include the de-coupling
  of systems of differential equations, that can now be learned independently; the
  possibility of exploiting established techniques for standard symbolic regression,
  after trivial operations on the original dataset; and the substantial reduction
  of computational effort, when compared to existing ad-hoc solutions for the same
  purpose. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed approach on an instance
  of the Lotka-Volterra model.'
