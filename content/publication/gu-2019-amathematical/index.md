abstract: A better understanding of protein fouling during the thermal treatment of
  whey protein concentrate (WPC) solutions is critical for better fouling control.
  In order to understand the impact of various parameters on the total whey protein
  fouling mass, a dimensional analysis was applied to the experimental data obtained
  from a pilot scale plate heat exchanger, setting total fouling mass as the target
  variable. A model was developed to predict the total fouling mass, covering a series
  of variables including whey protein solution concentration (2.5–25 g/L), calcium
  concentration (70-120 ppm), running time (90-330 min), fouling solution flow rate
  (200-500 L/h), total fouling surface area, outlet temperature (82-97 °C) and differences
  in whey protein concentrate powders. In addition to temperature dimensionless parameters,
  the main parameters involved in the model are the Reynolds number (2000-5000) and
  the calcium to β-lactoglobulin molar ratio (2.7–34.7). The model developed concerns
  only pure whey proteins solutions since all the testing solutions were casein free.
  This model has allowed us to provide guidelines as to how the above parameters influence
  fouling within the plate heat exchanger, as well as empirical correlations for predicting
  such fouling development.
