 abstract = {This chapter, published in a French book, explores the sustainability of agricultural landscapes by conceptualizing it as a multi-objective optimization problem. Agricultural landscapes, characterized by diverse land uses and ecosystem services, require management approaches that balance trade-offs and synergies among these services. Management actions aimed at maximizing a single ecosystem service often degrade others, reducing landscape multifunctionality and sustainability.
The study underscores the importance of modeling to predict ecosystem service outcomes under varying land-use scenarios. Multi-service models incorporate management variables (e.g., crop type, fertilizer use) and external factors (e.g., climate, market prices) to forecast ecosystem service portfolios. These models enable the simulation of alternative management strategies and their impacts on service provision, facilitating the identification of Pareto-efficient solutions. Pareto efficiency highlights trade-offs where improving one service compromises another, guiding decision-makers in prioritizing objectives.
Evolutionary algorithms are proposed as a robust tool for identifying optimal solutions within complex multi-objective landscapes. By simulating natural selection, these algorithms generate a diverse set of solutions that approximate the Pareto front. A case study in France's Massif Central demonstrates the approach, optimizing services like carbon sequestration, animal production, and crop yields. Results reveal synergies between certain services (e.g., carbon sequestration and animal production) and trade-offs with others (e.g., crop yields).
The study concludes that multi-objective optimization methods make trade-offs explicit and facilitate the exploration of alternative landscape configurations. Integrating these insights with participatory approaches ensures practical and socially acceptable solutions for sustainable landscape management.},
