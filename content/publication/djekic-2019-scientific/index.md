abstract: 'This paper gives an overview of scientific challenges that occur when performing
  life-cycle assessment (LCA) in the food supply chain. In order to evaluate these
  risks, the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis tool has been used. Challenges related
  to setting the goal and scope of LCA revealed four hot spots: system boundaries
  of LCA; used functional units; type and quality of data categories, and main assumptions
  and limitations of the study. Within the inventory analysis, challenging issues
  are associated with allocation of material and energy flows and waste streams released
  to the environment. Impact assessment brings uncertainties in choosing appropriate
  environmental impacts. Finally, in order to interpret results, a scientifically
  sound sensitivity analysis should be performed to check how stable calculations
  and results are. Identified challenges pave the way for improving LCA of food supply
  chains in order to enable comparison of results.'
