abstract: "Among Real-Time Strategy games few titles have enjoyed the continued success
  of StarCraft. Many research lines aimed at developing Artificial Intelligences,
  or ``bots'', capable of challenging human players, use StarCraft as a platform.
  Several characteristics make this game particularly appealing for researchers, such
  as: asymmetric balanced factions, considerable complexity of the technology trees,
  large number of units with unique features, and potential for optimization both
  at the strategical and tactical level. In literature, various works exploit evolutionary
  computation to optimize particular aspects of the game, from squad formation to
  map exploration; but so far, no evolutionary approach has been applied to the development
  of a complete strategy from scratch. In this paper, we present the preliminary results
  of StarCraftGP, a framework able to evolve a complete strategy for StarCraft, from
  the building plan, to the composition of squads, up to the set of rules that define
  the bot's behavior during the game. The proposed approach generates strategies as
  C++ classes, that are then compiled and executed inside the OpprimoBot open-source
  framework. In a first set of runs, we demonstrate that StarCraftGP ultimately generates
  a competitive strategy for a Zerg bot, able to defeat several human-designed bots."
