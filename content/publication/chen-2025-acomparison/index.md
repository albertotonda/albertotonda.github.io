abstract: The optimal allocation of crops to different parcels of land is a problem
  of paramount practical importance, not only to improve food and feed production,
  but also to address the challenges posed by climate change. However, this optimization
  problem is inherently complex due to the large number of agricultural sites available
  which generates a vast search space that renders traditional optimization techniques
  impractical. Moreover, as maximizing average production may generate solutions characterized
  by high year-by-year instability and lead to large and unrealistic cultivated areas,
  it is necessary to optimize crop allocation considering several objectives at the
  same time. In order to tackle this complex optimization problem, we propose a multi-objective
  approach, simultaneously maximizing the average production, minimizing the year-on-year
  production variance, and minimizing the total cultivated surface. The approach relies
  on an established multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, and employs a machine
  learning model able to predict crop production from weather and irrigation conditions,
  trained on historical data, making it possible to tackle allocation problems of
  large size. The proposed approach is compared to a quadratic programming algorithm
  tailored to the target problem. A case study focusing on the allocation of soybean
  crops in the European continent for the years 2000-2023 shows that the proposed
  methodology is able to identify informative trade-offs between the three conflicting
  objectives considered, and identify realistic and meaningful crop allocations for
  supporting stakeholders’ decisions.
