abstract: PySR 0.19.4 is an open-source, freely available Python module for Symbolic
  Regression (SR) written and maintained by Dr. Miles Cranmer of the University of
  Cambridge. The module relies upon an internal engine written in Julia (SymbolicRegression.jl),
  optimized for computational efficiency, which can also be employed separately in
  Julia projects. PySR has excellent documentation and is under active development.
