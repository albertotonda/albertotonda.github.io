 abstract = {PySR 0.19.4 is an open-source, freely available Python module for Symbolic Regression (SR) written and maintained by Dr. Miles Cranmer of the University of Cambridge. The module relies upon an internal engine written in Julia (SymbolicRegression.jl), optimized for computational efficiency, which can also be employed separately in Julia projects. PySR has excellent documentation and is under active development.},
