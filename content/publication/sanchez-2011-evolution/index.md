abstract: 'Microprocessor testing is becoming a challenging task, due to the increasing
  complexity of modern architectures. Nowadays, most architectures are tackled with
  a combination of scan chains and Software-Based Self-Test (SBST) methodologies.
  Among SBST techniques, evolutionary feedback-based ones prove effective in microprocessor
  testing: their main disadvantage, however, is the considerable time required to
  generate suitable test programs. A novel evolutionary-based approach, able to appreciably
  reduce the generation time, is presented. The proposed method exploits a high-level
  representation of the architecture under test and a dynamically built Finite State
  Machine (FSM) model to assess fault coverage without resorting to time-expensive
  simulations on low-level models. Experimental results, performed on an OpenRISC
  processor, show that the resulting test obtains a nearly complete fault coverage
  against the targeted fault model.'
