abstract: 'Wetlands are artificial ponds, designed to filter and purify running water
  through the contact with plant stems and roots. Wetland layouts are traditionally
  designed by experts through a laborious and time-consuming procedure: in principle,
  small patches of vegetation with purifying properties are tentatively placed, then
  the resulting water flow is verified by fluid dynamics simulators and when a satisfying
  outcome is reached, the wetland final layout is decided. This paper proposes to
  automate wetland design exploiting an evolutionary algorithm: a population of candidate
  solutions is cultivated by the evolutionary core, and their efficiency is evaluated
  using a state-of-the-art fluid-dynamics simulation framework. Experimental results
  show that the results obtained by the proposed approach are qualitatively comparable
  with those provided by experts, despite the complete absence of human intervention
  during the optimization process.'
