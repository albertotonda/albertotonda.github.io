abstract: Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNA molecules that can
  be detected in bodily fluids without the need for major invasive procedures on patients.
  miRNAs have shown great promise as biomarkers for tumors to both assess their presence
  and to predict their type and subtype. Recently, thanks to the availability of miRNAs
  datasets, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to tumor classification.
  The results, however, are difficult to assess and interpret by medical experts because
  the algorithms exploit information from thousands of miRNAs. In this work, we propose
  a novel technique that aims at reducing the necessary information to the smallest
  possible set of circulating miRNAs. The dimensionality reduction achieved reflects
  a very important first step in a potential, clinically actionable, circulating miRNA-based
  precision medicine pipeline. While it is currently under discussion whether this
  first step can be taken, we demonstrate here that it is possible to perform classification
  tasks by exploiting a recursive feature elimination procedure that integrates a
  heterogeneous ensemble of high-quality, state-of-the-art classifiers on circulating
  miRNAs. Heterogeneous ensembles can compensate inherent biases of classifiers by
  using different classification algorithms. Selecting features then further eliminates
  biases emerging from using data from different studies or batches, yielding more
  robust and reliable outcomes. The proposed approach is first tested on a tumor classification
  problem in order to separate 10 different types of cancer, with samples collected
  over 10 different clinical trials, and later is assessed on a cancer subtype classification
  task, with the aim to distinguish triple negative breast cancer from other subtypes
  of breast cancer. Overall, the presented methodology proves to be effective and
  compares favorably to other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.
