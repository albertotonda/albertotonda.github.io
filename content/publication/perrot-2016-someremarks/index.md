abstract: 'Background: Agri-food is one of the most important sectors of the industry
  in Europe and potentially a major contributor to the global warming. Sustainability
  issues in this context pose a huge challenge for several reasons: the variety of
  considered scales, the number of disciplines involved, the uncertainties, the out-of-equilibrium
  states, the complex quantitative and qualitative factors, the normative issues and
  the availability of data. Although important insight and breakthroughs have been
  attained in different scientific domains, an overarching and integrated analysis
  of these complex problems have yet to be realized. Scope and Approach: This context
  creates huge opportunities for research in interaction with mathematical programming,
  integrative models and decision-support tools. The paper propose a computational
  viewpoint including questions of holistic approach, multiscale reconstruction and
  optimization. Some directions are discussed. Key Findings and Conclusions: Several
  research questions based on a mathematical programming framework are emerging: how
  can such a framework manage uncertainty, cope with complex qualitative and quantitative
  information essential for social and environmental considerations, encompass diverse
  scales in space and time, cope with a multivariable dynamic environment and with
  scarcity of data. Moreover, how can it deal with different perspectives, types of
  models, research goals and data produced by conceptually disjoint scientific disciplines,
  ranging from physics and physiology to sociology and ethics? Building models is
  essential, but highly difficult; it will need a strong iterative interaction combining
  computational intensive methods, formal reasoning and the experts of the different
  fields. Some future research directions are proposed, involving all those dimensions:
  mathematical resilience, human-machine interactive learning and optimization techniques.'
