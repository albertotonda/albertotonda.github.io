abstract: This paper presents a proof of concept for a novel evolutionary methodology
  inspired by core knowledge. This theory describes human cognition as a small set
  of innate abilities combined through compositionality. The proposed approach generates
  predictive descriptions of the interaction between elements in simple 2D videos.
  It exploits well-known strategies, such as image segmentation, object detection,
  simple laws of physics (kinematics and dynamics), and evolving rules, including
  high-level classes and their interactions. The experimental evaluation focuses on
  two classic video games, Pong and Arkanoid. Analyzing a small number of raw video
  frames, the methodology identifies objects, classes, and rules, creating a compact,
  high-level, predictive description of the interactions between the elements in the
  videos.
