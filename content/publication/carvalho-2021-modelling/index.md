abstract: In recent years, modelling techniques have become more frequently adopted
  in the field of food processing, especially for cereal-based products, which are
  among the most consumed foods in the world. Predictive models and simulations make
  it possible to explore new approaches and optimize proceedings, potentially helping
  companies reduce costs and limit carbon emissions. Nevertheless, as the different
  phases of the food processing chain are highly specialized, advances in modelling
  are often unknown outside of a single domain, and models rarely take into account
  more than one step. This paper introduces the first high-level overview of modelling
  techniques employed in different parts of the cereal supply chain, from farming
  to storage, from drying to milling, from processing to consumption. This review,
  issued from a networking project including researchers from over 30 different countries,
  aims at presenting the current state of the art in each domain, showing common trends
  and synergies, to finally suggest promising future venues for research.
