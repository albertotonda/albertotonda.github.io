abstract: 'Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules heavily involved
  in human tumors, in which few of them circulating the human body. Finding a tumor-associated
  signature of miRNA, that is, the minimum miRNA entities to be measured for discriminating
  both different types of cancer and normal tissues, is of utmost importance. Feature
  selection techniques applied in machine learning can help however they often provide
  naive or biased results. Results: An ensemble feature selection strategy for miRNA
  signatures is proposed. miRNAs are chosen based on consensus on feature relevance
  from high-accuracy classifiers of different typologies. This methodology aims to
  identify signatures that are considerably more robust and reliable when used in
  clinically relevant prediction tasks. Using the proposed method, a 100-miRNA signature
  is identified in a dataset of 8023 samples, extracted from TCGA. When running eight-state-of-the-art
  classifiers along with the 100-miRNA signature against the original 1046 features,
  it could be detected that global accuracy differs only by 1.4%. Importantly, this
  100-miRNA signature is sufficient to distinguish between tumor and normal tissues.
  The approach is then compared against other feature selection methods, such as UFS,
  RFE, EN, LASSO, Genetic Algorithms, and EFS-CLA. The proposed approach provides
  better accuracy when tested on a 10-fold cross-validation with different classifiers
  and it is applied to several GEO datasets across different platforms with some classifiers
  showing more than 90% classification accuracy, which proves its cross-platform applicability.
  Conclusions: The 100-miRNA signature is sufficiently stable to provide almost the
  same classification accuracy as the complete TCGA dataset, and it is further validated
  on several GEO datasets, across different types of cancer and platforms. Furthermore,
  a bibliographic analysis confirms that 77 out of the 100 miRNAs in the signature
  appear in lists of circulating miRNAs used in cancer studies, in stem-loop or mature-sequence
  form. The remaining 23 miRNAs offer potentially promising avenues for future research.'
