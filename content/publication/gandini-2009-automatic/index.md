abstract: Mobile phones are becoming more and more complex devices, both from the
  hardware and from the software point of view. Consequently, their various parts
  are often developed separately. Each sub-system or application may be worked out
  by a specialized team of engineers and programmers. Frequently, bugs in one component
  are triggered by the complex interaction between the different applications. Those
  errors sometimes lead to power dissipation and other misbehaviors that lower residual
  battery life, a catastrophic event from the user perspective. In this paper we propose
  a model-based automatic approach to uncover software bugs, which is intended to
  complement human expertise and complete a qualifying verification plan. The system
  has been applied on the prototype of a Motorola mobile phone during a partnership
  with Politecnico di Torino. We demonstrate that our approach is effective by detecting
  three distinct software misbehaviours that escape all traditional tests. The paper
  details the methodology, tests and results.
