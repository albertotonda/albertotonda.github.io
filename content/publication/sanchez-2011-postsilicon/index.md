abstract: The incessant progress in manufacturing technology is posing new challenges
  to microprocessor designers. Several activities that were originally supposed to
  be part of the pre-silicon design phase are migrating after tape-out, when the first
  silicon prototypes are available. The paper describes a post-silicon methodology
  for devising functional failing tests. Therefore, suited to be exploited by microprocessor
  producer to detect, analyze and debug speed paths during verification, speed-stepping,
  or other critical activities. The proposed methodology is based on an evolutionary
  algorithm and exploits a versatile toolkit named Î¼GP. The paper describes how to
  take into account complex hardware characteristics and architectural details of
  such complex devices. The experimental evaluation clearly demonstrates the potential
  of this line of research.
