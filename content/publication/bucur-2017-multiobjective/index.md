abstract: As the pervasiveness of social networks increases, new NPhard related problems
  become interesting for the optimization community. The objective of influence maximization
  is to contact the largest possible number of nodes in a network, starting from a
  small set of seed nodes, and assuming a model for information propagation. This
  problem is of utmost practical importance for applications ranging from social studies
  to marketing. The influence maximization problem is typically formulated assuming
  that the number of the seed nodes is a parameter. Differently, in this paper, we
  choose to formulate it in a multi-objective fashion, considering the minimization
  of the number of seed nodes among the goals, and we tackle it with an evolutionary
  approach. As a result, we are able to identify sets of seed nodes of different size
  that spread influence the best, providing factual data to trade-off costs with quality
  of the result. The methodology is tested on two real-world case studies, using two
  different influence propagation models, and compared against state-of-the-art heuristic
  algorithms. The results show that the proposed approach is almost always able to
  outperform the heuristics.
