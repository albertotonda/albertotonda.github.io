abstract: "Gas chemical sensors are strongly affected by the so-called drift, i.e.,
  changes in sensors' response caused by poisoning and aging that may significantly
  spoil the measures gathered. The paper presents a mechanism able to correct drift,
  that is: delivering a correct unbiased fingerprint to the end user. The proposed
  system exploits a state-of-the-art evolutionary strategy to iteratively tweak the
  coefficients of a linear transformation. The system operates continuously. The optimal
  correction strategy is learnt without a-priori models or other hypothesis on the
  behavior of physical-chemical sensors. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
  of the approach on a real problem."
