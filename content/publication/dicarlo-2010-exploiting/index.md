abstract: Gas chemical sensors are strongly affected by drift, i.e., changes in sensors’
  response with time, that may turn statistical models commonly used for classification
  completely useless after a period of time. This paper presents a new classifier
  that embeds an adaptive stage able to reduce drift effects. The proposed system
  exploits a state-of-the-art evolutionary strategy to iteratively tweak the coefficients
  of a linear transformation able to transparently transform raw measures in order
  to mitigate the negative effects of the drift. The system operates continuously.
  The optimal correction strategy is learnt without a-priori models or other hypothesis
  on the behavior of physical-chemical sensors. Experimental results demonstrate the
  efficacy of the approach on a real problem.
