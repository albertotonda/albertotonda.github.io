abstract: Since centuries, agriculture, food and biological systems are strongly linked
  to human expertise, albeit such knowledge has been capitalized and shared often
  at a local level, only. Since the beginning of the last century, swept away by productivism,
  modern agriculture and food production have put cumulated human knowledge aside.
  Facing new challenges like sustainability in a changing context, holistic approaches
  cannot be managed ``manually'' ab initio and there is a clear need for computing
  decision-support tools to tackle these new issues. Moreover, new approaches should
  be built centred on humans and for humans. The heart of our purpose is to shift
  the focus again on human and local expertise, guided by powerful computing interactive
  systems.
