abstract: 'One of the most notable features of collectible card games is deckbuilding,
  that is, defining a personalized deck before the real game. Deckbuilding is a challenge
  that involves a big and rugged search space, with different and unpredictable behaviour
  after simple card changes and even hidden information. In this paper, we explore
  the possibility of automated deckbuilding: a genetic algorithm is applied to the
  task, with the evaluation delegated to a game simulator that tests every potential
  deck against a varied and representative range of human-made decks. In these preliminary
  experiments, the approach has proven able to create quite effective decks, a promising
  result that proves that, even in this challenging environment, evolutionary algorithms
  can find good solutions.'
