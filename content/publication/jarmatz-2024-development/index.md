abstract: 'Fouling is the unwanted accumulation of material on a processing surface
  which is an especially problematic issue in the food industry. Characterizing or
  predicting fouling through traditional methods or models is a challenge due to the
  complexity of fouling mechanisms. Machine learning (ML) techniques can overcome
  this challenge by creating models for prediction directly from experimental data.
  Unfortunately, the results can be hard to interpret depending on the algorithm.
  Here, a soft sensor is generated from an extensive data set to predict the fouling
  of a model particle material system. This is performed inside two different pipe
  fittings, an inaccessible and accessible fitting (e.g., for sensor measurements).
  Additionally, dimensional analysis (DA) is conducted to identify the correlations
  responsible for fouling while keeping descriptors with physical meaning. The resulting
  dimensionless numbers (DNs) are further processed by three ML algorithms: linear
  regression (LR), symbolic regression (SR), and random forest (RF). The soft sensor
  generated using a RF outperformed the other two regressors for the dimensional (Q2=0.90±0.08)
  and for the dimensionless data (Q2=0.88±0.09). The parameter time and particle mass
  fraction were determined to be most influential. Furthermore, seven DNs were obtained
  allowing a reduced experimental design.'
