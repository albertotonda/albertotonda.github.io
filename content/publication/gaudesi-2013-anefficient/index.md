abstract: 'Defining a distance measure over the individuals in the population of an
  Evolutionary Algorithm can be exploited for several applications, ranging from diversity
  preservation to balancing exploration and exploitation. When individuals are encoded
  as strings of bits or sets of real values, computing the distance between any two
  can be a straightforward process; when individuals are represented as trees or linear
  graphs, however, quite often the user must resort to phenotype-level problem-specific
  distance metrics. This paper presents a generic genotype-level distance metric for
  Linear Genetic Programming: the information contained by an individual is represented
  as a set of symbols, using n-grams to capture significant recurring structures inside
  the genome. The difference in information between two individuals is evaluated resorting
  to a symmetric difference. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed metric
  has a strong correlation with phenotype-level problem-specific distance measures
  in two problems where individuals represent string of bits and Assembly-language
  programs, respectively.'
