During the 2024 summer I spent almost two months visiting the researchers and students at the [Centre for Data Science and	Artificial Intelligence](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/cdsai) of [Victoria University of Wellington (VUW)](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/), New Zealand. Prof. Mengjie Zhang and his colleagues warmly welcomed me in spite of the relatively cold weather of the austral hemisphere, and we had a excellent exchange of ideas; not to mention, I had the opportunity of working again with the brilliant Ph.D. student Hengzhe Zhang, with whom I previously collaborated.

Thanks again to Prof. Mengjie Zhang and all his colleagues (Bing Xue, Xiaoying Gao, Fangfang Zhang, Hui Ma, and many others I am surely forgetting) for inviting me and for the warm welcome!
