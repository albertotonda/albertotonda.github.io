The New Zealand embassy in Paris organized an event to celebrate 20 years of research collaboration between France and their country. The event included a delegation from NZ, aiming to establish collaborations for participation in Horizon projects. In the scope of their visit, I will also present the activities of my research team during another meeting at Ecole Polytechnique later during the week.
