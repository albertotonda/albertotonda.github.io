I was recently invited at the [M2Sud event](https://pole-sci-m2sud.paca.inrae.fr/node/25) organized by the [INRAE lab of Sophie Antipolis](https://institut-sophia-agrobiotech.paca.hub.inrae.fr/), near Antibes, where I had the opportunity of presenting ongoing, unpublished work on symbolic regression for learning dynamical systems. Many of the other presentations were also focused on the topic of obtaining human-interpretable, predictive models of dynamical systems for plants and bacteria, a strong emerging trend in machine learning.
