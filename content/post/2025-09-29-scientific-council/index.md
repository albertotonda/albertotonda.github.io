I had the privilege of replacing my colleague [Nathalie Gontard](https://www.inrae.fr/en/news/nathalie-gontard-total-package) in [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr)'s scientific council as a representative of my department, [TRANSFORM](https://www.inrae.fr/en/divisions/transform). INRAE, the French national institute of research in agriculture, food, and the environment, is one of the largest agricultural and environmental research organization in the world, employing more than 10,000 people. Its scientific council is an important instance, including both elected and nominated representatives, to track INRAE's current work and define future research directions.
