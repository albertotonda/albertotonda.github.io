Lots of fun and interesting presentations at EvoSTAR 2025! It is always exciting to see what's new in the evolutionary domain.

Congrats to Arthur Lequertier, the student I am co-supervising along with his main supervisor Wolfram Liebermeister, for being the runner-up for best poster, with the work titled "Inferring Reaction Elasticities in Cells from Metabolic State Correlations through Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization"!
