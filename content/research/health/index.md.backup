In recent years, my research activities have branched to the application of ML and EAs to bioinformatics, thanks to a long-standing collaboration with the University of Utrecht (The Netherlands), with the recent addition of partners from the University of Cambridge (UK). The case studies I tackled include automatic discovery of micro-RNA signatures for tumors~\cite{lopezrincon2019automatic,lopezrincon2018evolutionary,barbiero2019understanding}, batch correction of genomic datasets~\cite{lopezrincon2020batch}, and automatic primer design for viruses, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2~\cite{lopezrincon2021classification,lopezrincon2021design}. Following these activities, I joined COST Action CA18131 \emph{Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques in Human Microbiome Studies} (2019-2023), where I am currently one of the two representatives for France in the Management Committee.
