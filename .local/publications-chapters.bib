  title = {On the Functional Test of Branch Prediction Units Based on the Branch History Table Architecture},
  booktitle = {{VLSI}-{SoC}: Advanced Research for Systems on Chip},
  abstract = {Branch Prediction Units (BPUs) are commonly used in pipelined processors, since they can significantly decrease the negative impact of branches in superscalar and RISC architectures. Traditional solutions, mainly based on scan, are often inadequate to effectively test these modules: in particular, scan does not represent a viable solution when Incoming Inspection or on-line test are considered. Functional test may stand as an effective solution in these situations, but requires effective algorithms to be available. In this paper we propose a functional approach targeting the test of BPUs based on the Branch History Table (BHT) architecture; the proposed approach is independent on the specific implementation of the BPU, and is thus widely applicable. Its effectiveness has been validated on a BPU resorting to an open-source computer architecture simulator and to an ad hoc developed HDL testbench. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to thoroughly test the BPU, reaching complete static fault coverage with reasonable requirements in terms of test program size and execution time.}

  booktitle = {Human and Machine Learning},
  abstract = {The apparent simplicity of food processes often hides complex systems, where physical, chemical and living organisms’ processes co-exist and interact to create the final product. Data can be plagued by uncertainty; heterogeneity of available information is likely; qualitative and quantitative data may also coexist in the same process, from expert perception of food quality to nano-properties of ingredients. In order to obtain reliable models, it then becomes necessary to acquire additional information from external sources. Experts of a domain can provide invaluable insight in products and processes, but this precious knowledge is often available only in the form of intuition and implicit expertise. Including expert insight in a model can be tackled by having humans interacting with a machine learning process, through visualization or via specialists in encoding implicit domain knowledge. In this chapter, three selected case studies in food science portray different success stories of combining machine learning and expert interaction. We show that expert knowledge can be integrated at different stages of the modelling process, either online or offline, to initialize, enrich or guide this process.}

  abstract = {This chapter, published in a French book, explores the sustainability of agricultural landscapes by conceptualizing it as a multi-objective optimization problem. Agricultural landscapes, characterized by diverse land uses and ecosystem services, require management approaches that balance trade-offs and synergies among these services. Management actions aimed at maximizing a single ecosystem service often degrade others, reducing landscape multifunctionality and sustainability.
  The study underscores the importance of modeling to predict ecosystem service outcomes under varying land-use scenarios. Multi-service models incorporate management variables (e.g., crop type, fertilizer use) and external factors (e.g., climate, market prices) to forecast ecosystem service portfolios. These models enable the simulation of alternative management strategies and their impacts on service provision, facilitating the identification of Pareto-efficient solutions. Pareto efficiency highlights trade-offs where improving one service compromises another, guiding decision-makers in prioritizing objectives.
  Evolutionary algorithms are proposed as a robust tool for identifying optimal solutions within complex multi-objective landscapes. By simulating natural selection, these algorithms generate a diverse set of solutions that approximate the Pareto front. A case study in France's Massif Central demonstrates the approach, optimizing services like carbon sequestration, animal production, and crop yields. Results reveal synergies between certain services (e.g., carbon sequestration and animal production) and trade-offs with others (e.g., crop yields).
  The study concludes that multi-objective optimization methods make trade-offs explicit and facilitate the exploration of alternative landscape configurations. Integrating these insights with participatory approaches ensures practical and socially acceptable solutions for sustainable landscape management.}

  abstract = {In the context of global warming and environmental pressure, food chains must adapt to new production conditions while satisfying the evolving consumer demand. Livestock production is known for its negative ecological footprint, bringing forward the question of a possible transition towards more plant-based diets. Citizens' demand evolves at different speeds and integrates these new environmental concerns sometimes mixed with health or ethical issues. We carried out a survey with 1,715 respondents in France, about their food choice priorities and preferences, as well as the drivers of change. Our results indicate that 40\% of respondents claim that their current diet is not what they would ideally have and 98\% of them would like to reduce their animal product consumption. Classification algorithms reveals several salient variables separating classes of individuals wishing to shift their food diet towards less animal products: the willingness to change is stronger for the youngest, factors impacting the willingness to change are food pleasure, health and to a lesser extent social resistance and animal ethics. The less radical the animal product reduction is, the more environmental concerns become the main motivation.}

It starts by describing different components of optimization problems and their taxonomy. Nature-inspired computing techniques, created to solve such optimization problems, are then discussed. The chapter briefs the application prospects of nature-inspired optimization techniques in a few representative emerging domains that are covered in the book. Applications presented in this book cover five major domains, which include Controller and Power Systems, Ecological and Economic Systems, Information and Computational Systems, Communication and Networking Systems, and Deep Learning and Neural Networking Systems. The book primarily focuses on the practical challenges that are faced while applying nature-inspired algorithms to different problems in these domains, which include the feasibility of the problem, control parameters and constraints, representation of the solution space, and design of the objective function. Lastly, the chapter concluded by highlighting common challenges, criticisms, and future perspectives.}
