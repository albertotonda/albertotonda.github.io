  title = {Food Model Exploration through Evolutionary Optimisation Coupled with Visualisation: Application to the Prediction of a Milk Gel Structure},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the DREAM International Conference ``From Model Foods to Food Model''},
  abstract = {Replicating in silico the structuring dynamics of gel formation stabilized by proteins is a relevant challenge for a better understanding of those complex systems.
  Nevertheless, in order to exploit the potentiality of the models, effective means to visualize the space of possible solutions must be used. As models of food processes become more and more complex, it also becomes harder for the experts to thoroughly explore their behavior and find meaningful correlations between parameters. If sensibility analysis approaches are powerful tools to answer to a part of this problem, they do not allow the global visualization of the nature of the link taking place between variables. This information may nevertheless be relevant for a better understanding of the law involved in the mechanisms under study.
  While an analytical study is often impractical, graphical visualization tools can help the user to better understand the behavior of the model, as well as the possible improvements to be performed. Nevertheless, an effective way to explore the model behavior must be employed. In this paper, we propose an approach to model exploration that couples visualization with evolutionary computation. The case study is a model devised to predict milk gel structures, based on a system of differential equations with a total of 5 parameters to be set by the expert. Sensitivity analysis on the model has been already presented in previous works.
  During the experiment, several meta-data are extracted and made available to the expert: the space distribution of all candidate solutions proposed by the evolutionary algorithm; the space distribution of all optimal candidate solutions; and global data on the space distribution of the points, for each parameter of the model. We show that, using the proposed approach, experts are able to reduce the dimension of the model, eventually finding a correlation between two of the variables. Reverse-engineering the final outcome of the experiment, the emergence of such a pattern is explained by physical laws underlying the oil-in-water interface colonization. Thus, the proposed approach shows an improvement over the results of the sole sensitivity analysis.
  While the present work is focused on milk gel modeling, the described methodology can be generalized to any kind of phenomenon, and can greatly assist the experts in better assessing the behavior of their models.

  booktitle = {Proceedings of the International Bionic Engineering Conference},
  abstract = {Artificial Olfaction (AO) is a topical branch of bio-inspired artificial intelligence with formidable challenges and potential impacts. Robots equipped with Electronic Noses (ENs) could assist humans in detecting toxic gases or explosives. Despite progress in the last decade, mimicking human olfaction capabilities remains a challenge. ENs could offer a simple, fast, and economic alternative to traditional quality control techniques in industries like food processing. However, sensor drift is a major limitation, requiring frequent recalibration and incurring high costs. Conventional pattern recognition (PaRC) models become ineffective over time, necessitating adaptive strategies. In this paper, a novel methodology using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) is proposed. CMA-ES is a stochastic optimization method inspired by biological evolution that adapts correction parameters in small time windows to address drift. The methodology minimizes deviations of drift-corrected samples from their training-class centroids. It was validated on experimental data from the EOS835 EN prototype, measuring 545 samples of organic vapors. Four classifiers —- kNN, PLS, ANN, and Random Forest (RF) —- were tested, with Orthogonal Signal Correction (OSC) as a baseline comparison. CMA-ES outperformed OSC, demonstrating robust long-term adaptation even with limited data. The findings indicate that CMA-ES effectively mitigates drift, providing flexibility across classifiers and ensuring reliable performance over time.}

  title = {Assessing Trends on Consumption of Animal Products Through a Machine Learning Analysis of Consumer Motivations},
  booktitle = {Online Workshop on Computational Approaches in Eating Behavior Research},
  abstract = {Consumer demand is constantly evolving, and in recent years plant-based diets are becoming more appealing to the general public. However, consumers' preferences evolve at different speeds, integrating environmental concerns, health considerations, and ethical issues. It is therefore important to be able to identify and separate trends in demand among the general public. From the data collected through a survey of 1,715 respondents in France, concerning priorities, preferences, and drivers of change in food choice, we performed an in-depth analysis through machine learning techniques such as clustering and classification. While 40\% of the interviewed reported that their current diet is different from their ideal, and 98\% of them wished to reduce their consumption of animal products, our analysis revealed several salient variables that characterize different classes of individuals. For example, the willingness to change the diet is stronger for the younger population, while the main obstacles against adopting a plant-based diet are food pleasure, health concerns, and to a lesser extent social resistance and animal ethics. From the analysis, it seems that environmental concerns are the main motivation especially for people that reduce their consumption of animal products in a less radical way.}

In this work we build an agent-based model of gastric digestion of some gel pieces of plant proteins (rapeseed). This model has been designed to allow a faster computation compared with dynamic molecular models, fast calculations are actually a prerequisite for learning a model from experimental data. We have so far exploited additional coarse-grained equation-based models to learn some parameters using evolutionary optimization. Future developments will be devoted to the learning of all the parameters.}
